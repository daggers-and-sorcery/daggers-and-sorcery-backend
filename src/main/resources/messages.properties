# Forest journey exploration event
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The patrons of the Drunken Dragoon told you strange stories about the Whispering Wood last night, and it sparked your curiosity. Were the stories true? Could you actually hear whispers? You travel to the forest edge and listen for a few moments. The breeze blew by and rustles the leaves, and then, all goes silent. You take a deep breath and squeeze your eyes shut to help you focus. Just faintly, there is a voice...no voices. They are soft and so, so gentle - beckoning to you. What are they saying?
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=You venture into the forest despite the warning signs. The whispers are growing louder and fighting to be heard. A chorus of disjointed thoughts surrounds you. The whispers persist until their message melds together. They come from no singular place. They are everywhere and closing in fast. You spin in a slow circle and struggle to understand them. What are they saying?!
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=An eerie shriek startles you, and a Goblin Guard drops from a tree. You dodge the creature's oncoming attack and hurry to protect yourself.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=As soon as you defeat the Goblin Guard, rapid footsteps crash through the undergrowth. The wild grass shakes as another Goblin Guard bursts from the foliage. He withdraws his weapon and senses your presence.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=There might be more of them! You sprint toward a thicket and conceal yourself. The Goblin Guard discovers his fallen comrade and snarls angrily, baring his crooked teeth. His yellow gaze sweeps over your hiding place, and you cover your mouth, struggling to keep quiet. His suspicions turn elsewhere which gives you an opportunity to strike!
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You slay the Goblin Guard before he can alert his tribemates. You back away from the bodies and retreat to Farmfields.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=There might be more of them! You sprint toward a thicket and conceal yourself. The Goblin Guard discovers his fallen comrade and snarls angrily, baring his crooked teeth. His yellow gaze sweeps over your hiding place, and he sees you! You abandon the thicket as more Goblins appear. Their enraged shrieks haunt you until you escape the forest. Beware of goblins. They travel in packs.

# Robbing the Chieftains exploration event
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1="Adventurer, we need your help! A goblin tribe lurks deep in the Whispering Wood, and they've been attacking innocent travelers. We're under orders to remain in Sevgard. Warn the farmers! Keep them safe!" a desperate guard insists.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=You have encountered these goblins in the past. They aggressively slaughter livestock and destroy precious crops. These goblins must be stopped before they harm anyone else. "I'll find the goblins myself," you assure.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=Departing the guard post, you march straight to the forest and plan to eliminate the goblins once and for all. You bypass the main path and discover a thick trail of blood leading into the foliage. It appears the goblins snagged another farm animal, dragging it ruthlessly away. The crimson droplets provide a direct course to the goblin camp. As you draw nearer, you struggle to navigate dense, spider-webbing roots, extending from a massive, sickly tree. Gnarled knots protrude from the hollow oak, and dark sap oozes from its wounds. You crouch behind a cluster of hanging roots and notice a pig roasting above a cookfire. You count the goblins patrolling the camp. If you sneak closer, you might be able to catch them by surprise.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=You take a deep breath and inch forward slowly. The hanging roots conceal your position, and you sneak to the opposing side of the camp. A large tent rests in front of you and may contain valuable loot. You remove a dagger from your belt and cut a hole in the fabric. You tear the tent open softly and crawl inside. A blanket covers an elaborate bone chest, and you reach to open it. However, the chest is tightly locked. You shake the chest persistently just as the Goblin Chieftain enters his tent. He drops his pork haunch in surprise and screeches before charging you.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=You kill the Goblin Chieftain and discover an ebony key hanging from his belt. You unlock the chest and receive {0}. You hear enraged shrieks from the other side of the clearing and hurriedly collect your loot. You scramble away from the tent and sprint into the forest. The goblins do not follow you. They are too busy mourning the death of their chieftain. You return to Sevard to report to the guards.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You take a deep breath and sprint toward a mossy rock. You slide behind it and peek slowly at the patrolling Goblin Guards. Before you can regain your bearings, dirt clumps fling against you. You whirl around and come face to face with a frantic Goblin Guard. He was already hiding here and burying his loot! The Goblin Guard curses loudly and attacks you.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=The Goblin Guard squeals and collapses on his partially buried loot. You freeze when a series of shrieks erupts from behind the rock. Not good! You forsake your plan and flee from the goblin camp. Angering a goblin tribe isn't worth it - not today at least.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=**You gained {0}.**

# Wolf attack exploration event
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=A local leatherworker requires wolf pelts for the upcoming winter season, and he enlists you for the job. You depart for the forest immediately and discover a set of wolf tracks along the path. During the night, the wolves creep out of their dens and devour unattended livestock, and as a result, an elite hunting guild formed. Hunting parties enter the forest daily, yet the wolf population refuses to dwindle. This greatly benefits Sevgard and the master leatherworkers who craft for the kingdom. However, their prices can be quite steep, so you're willing to assist a local who cannot afford quality fur.
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=The wolf tracks divert from the path and lead deep into the foliage. You move slowly and watch where you step. Hunters litter the ground with traps and forget to retrieve them. You imagine steel teeth snapping through your ankle and trapping you in place. The scent of blood would attract predators, and they would devour you alive. The thought disturbs you. Just last week, a farmhand drifted off the path to collect flowers and stepped directly into a bear trap. Now, he hobbles around Farmfields on a pair of crutches. He's still lucky to have his foot!
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=A dark, brown wolf bears his teeth and rises from the undergrowth. He must have been sleeping! The beast shifts into a crouch before pouncing.
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=You kill the wolf and drag its body further into the clearing. While you were fighting, night fell and plunged your surroundings into darkness. It's unsafe to trek home, so you decide to make camp. You construct a campfire and set up your tent before returning to the wolf's body. You remove a knife from your belt and begin skinning the pelt from the creature. A series of howls alarms you. With horror, you notice glowing eyes surrounding the clearing. You snatch a burning stick from the fire and wave it in front of you. The wolves snarl and prowl in a circle, but they never drift closer. You relax and scoot over to the fire. This would be a long night.
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=By dawn, the wolves lose interest and fade into the forest. You pack up camp and return to the leatherworker.

# Woodcutters exploration event
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=While exploring the forest, you notice tendrils of smoke rising above the treetops. You push through fronds and step onto a man-made path. Wagon and horse tracks engrave the path and lead to a steady, chopping sound. Cautiously, you abandon your cover and approach a crowd of stumps and woodchips. A campfire roars a few feet away with firewood nestled beside it. Several carts border the camp with gigantic logs loaded inro the back. A tawny horse studies you before grazing in a nearby meadow. It's only a woodcutting camp. That's a relief.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2="Adventurer, you can join us for supper if you help us. There's only four trees left," a strong woodcutter insists.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=You leave the shadows and grab an ax embedded in a stump. You cross to the closest tree and adjust your grip. Bending your knees, you swing the ax and hear it crunch into the trunk. You remove the ax and swing again. You fall into a rhythm and chop away at the rough bark. When you reach halfway, a woodcutter joins you, and you make quick work of the tree. With a mighty moan, the great oak topples to the ground and joins a pile of felled trees. You move onto the next tree until the job is complete.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=By now, you're sweaty, sore, and exhausted. The woodcutters gather around the fire and discuss recipes. They decide on lasagna, but none of them possess cooking skills. You offer to assist them, and within the hour, everyone is enjoying a delicious meal. Upon finishing, you crawl into a nearby tent and fall asleep with a warm belly.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=The woodcutters wake at dawn and prepare the logs for shipping. Leftover breakfast brews in the cauldron, and you help yourself. The head woodcutter thanks you and offers you {0} Bronze coins as a parting gift. You gratefully accept the gift and bid all of the woodcutters goodbye.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=**You gained {0} Bronze Coins.**

UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=Sun was sending its rays shyly through branches of the Whispering Woods as you were trailblazing through the unknown yet again. Determination to map the whole forest keeps you up and running, while various treasures you find are just a material reward – your true reward are adventures. Lost in thoughts about you being named the greatest explorer of the Whispering Woods, your name written in all geographical books, you were unaware of a boulder beneath your feet – it was high enough to touch your knees, yet you fell over it, hitting the nearby grass.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Standing up, a bit angry, you noticed a big hole near the boulder. Tracks in the grass and dirt indicate that the boulder was used to cover the hole. The bottom of the hole cannot be seen, the interior is pitch black. You swiftly grab your backpack to see if you have any torch and a rope – the more you see down there, the better you’ll be prepared for whatever awaits you.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=“Damn, I forgot my torch and rope! I better head back to town to grab them. All the battle expertise is of no use if I can’t see a damn thing.”
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=“There they are! Time for some underground exploring!”
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=A tight knot on the rope, tied around the boulder, secured it. You double checked it – better safe than sorry! Torch lit and held in right hand, you descend. Judging by descending speed and duration, the hole is approximately 4 meters deep, and you instantly thank your good decision to bring torch and rope with you. The fall would definitely hurt, but what would’ve killed you were the traps on the bottom – you counted 23 sharp, 30 centimeters long, blade edges. There’s another rope, hanging on the ceiling of the underground cave, which enabled the passing of the trap. After about two minutes of walk you noticed that the cave is lit with torches, which were hanging on walls. The cave walls seem old but pretty solid, with some runes here and there. After more walking, you encounter a branching – one path leads left, and the other leads right.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=Something drew you to choose the right path. You walked cautiously and slowly, but you suddenly heard footsteps. There’s someone else here!
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=“Maybe he, or she, is peaceful? The trap’s for… Bears, goblins and other creatures, maybe?”.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=Staying optimistic, however, didn’t pay off. Right before your eyes was a smuggler, and the cave was his secret stash. It didn’t take much for the agile smuggler to notice you.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=“Not many have found this place. But none of them lived to tell the tale of my hideout” smuggler said.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_10=“I’m guessing these are not rightfully yours”, you replied arrogantly, and added: “I’ll do you a favor, bring them back to the citizens of Sevgard. After all, I’m a good Samaritan, and don’t want you to hurt your back or something. Give these goods back peacefully, and I’ll let you live, and give you a chance for a fair trial. Deal?”
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=The smuggler arrogantly laughed as he pulled a long curved blade from sheath. “Mwahaha, I don’t know if you’re too courageous or too stupid. Either way, you’re going to die. Pity, really, I kind of started to like you” he said as he charged towards you.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_12=“He’s so hotheaded and full of that ignorant pride. Time to show him why bullying the weak is not the way.” You thought to yourself as you grabbed your weapon and prepared to fend the attacker.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_13=“His tongue was sharper than his blade, and his ignorance was far greater than his battle prowess. Time to see what we have in these chests!” were your first thoughts after defeating the ignorant bandit. Smuggler’s mauled body was lying next to wooden boxes and linen sacks, which you looted and found {0}.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_14=You grabbed as many antiques as you could, and rushed to the other side of the cave, to check what’s hidden there, but were unpleasantly surprised as you saw that the wall has collapsed.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_15=“Ah, well. This is still better than nothing. I know these sigils on these antiques, and know to which house they belong. Owners will be happy to see them again in their hands!” you said and rushed to the exit. If one wall collapsed, whole cave could as well!
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_16=After a long walk, you enjoyed praises as you returned the stolen belongings to the rightful owners, and got rewarded nicely. You drank and ate for free, got {0} silver coins for your valiant effort, and shared your experience with other adventurers and townsfolk. In their hearts, you’re a hero, protector and inspiration!
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_17=Left side is first, so you chose it. It didn’t take long for you to come by a whole lot of boxes, chests and some sacks. “This has to be a hideout of a smuggler! Let’s see what we have here”  you thought to yourself while starting to loot all the chests. You’ve found {0}, and many antiques.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_18=“I recognize sigils on these antiques! This one belongs to the House of Wolfthorn, while this one belongs to the House of Elleos! They must be worth a lot of gold on the black market. I’ll return them to their rightful owners!”  you thought as you grabbed as many antiques as you could, and then rushed to the other side of the cave, to check what is hidden there, but were unpleasantly surprised as you saw that the wall has collapsed.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_19=“Ah, well. This is still better than nothing. I know these sigils on these antiques, and know to which house they belong. Owners will be happy to see them again in their hands!” you said and rushed to the exit. If one wall collapsed, whole cave could as well!
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_20=After a long walk, you enjoyed praises as you returned the stolen belongings to the rightful owners, and got rewarded nicely. You drank and ate for free, got {0} silver coins and shared your experience with other adventurers and townsfolk. In their hearts, you’re a hero, protector and inspiration!
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Go on the right path.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Go on the left path.

# The Inn exploration event
THE_INN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=You stand up and draw the attention of a pale green Orc Brigand. He sneers at you with his crooked teeth and removes a sharp dagger from his leather belt. You return his glare and prepare yourself for a fight.

# River Cave Deja Vu exploration event
RIVER_CAVE_DEJA_VU_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=On the other side, you notice clusters of clay pots and urns with bronze coins scattered around them. However, you are not alone. A Goblin Piker sits crisscross in the middle of the room and seems to be meditating. His formidable pike rests across his lap with his green fingers clasped tightly around it. You debate on returning whence you came though an urn rests only a few feet away. As you pick it up, it slips straight from your grasp due to a thick coating of slime. The urn shatters and alerts the Goblin Piker. He snarls at you and raises his sharp pike.

# One bandit is no bandit exploration event
ONE_BANDIT_IS_NO_BANDIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=In the morning, you pack a bag with sufficient supplies and leave Sevgard. You approach Farmfields and recall the path to Pete the Farmer's home. You plan on offering your services to the farmer, and hopefully, he would lower his pride and accept your offer. You daydream about fresh vegetables and meats but halt when you notice a dark figure ahead of you. A Bandit Brigand wearing all black leans against a wooden post and tosses a dagger up and down, catching it perfectly by the hilt. He notices you and snickers beneath a crimson bandana. He sprints toward you, giving you barely enough time to react.

# The bridge exploration event
THE_BRIDGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The Goblin Guard crouches next to a cook fire, and he turns a crudely constructed spit. A skinned rat spins slowly with its long tail dipping into the flames. The rat tail burns off, and with gnashing teeth, the Goblin Guard snatches it from the embers and shoves it into his mouth. He struggles to eat the rubbery tail but seems to be enjoying the taste. The Goblin Guard turns to prep another rat when he notices you standing in the river. He shrieks furiously and attacks you.

# Cave at the river exploration event
CAVE_AT_THE_RIVER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=A rock formation rests to your left, and you notice an opening to a large den. Upon closer inspection, there are piles of small animal bones scattered around the entrance along with pawprints. You stiffen as you hear a muffled growl from behind you. You turn slowly and see a {0} with a silver fish clenched in its jaws. The {0} drops the fish and charges you aggressively.

# Goblin raiding party exploration event
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The Goblin Pikeman falls to the ground, and you whirl around. You caught the first Goblin Pikemen off guard, but the rest of them are ready.
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=The Goblin Shaman falls to the ground. You glare at the remainder. You are about to attack when you realize the goblins are running away. Cowards! You sprint after them, but they have a head start. The goblins disappear into the woods like rats, and it is impossible to follow them. You retreat to the farmer and describe the situation. You insist on staying the night in case the goblins return, and for your trouble, the farmer gives you a pouch of bronze coins.
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=You promise the goblins will be dead by nightfall and leave the farm promptly. The hills are a stone throw away, and you even see smoke rising from a cook fire. These goblins have become arrogant. It is the middle of the day! You trek up a slope and notice a goblin encampment with bones strewn everywhere. It seems like they have been gorging themselves. With an enraged cry, you charge down the hill and attack a Goblin Pikeman.
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=**You gained {0} Bronze Coins.**

# Abandoned hunting lodge exploration event
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=After a long day of rest, you decide to further explore the Whispering Woods. Treacherous paths, covered with leaves, moss and wild animal footprints can leave you to most unexpected places. As you’re making your way through thick forest, you see a strange light coming from the north east. Adventure spirit within your heart leads you to the source of the light – an abandoned hunting lodge. You circle around the lodge, and see that it’s very preserved, but overgrown in vines and moss.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Curiosity drives you forward, and you decide to enter the lodge. As soon as you opened the door, a Gnoll sees you and draws his weapon and charges you. Gnolls are vicious, territorial and very fast – you cannot outrun it, so you draw your weapon and prepare for a fight!
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=The battle was fierce, but the vicious creature stood no chance against you. As the Gnoll tumbled down the stairs at the lodge entrance, releasing the last shriek of pain, you enter the cabin. You look around the lodge and consider trying to search for any treasures that Gnoll might have collected.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=The battle drew too much of your strength. You decide to leave the lodge for now, as you might need all the strength you can get on your way home – you never know what lurks in the forest, and watches over passengers, their potential prey.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=After spending some time searching the lodge, you fail to find anything of use to you.  You can’t help but feel that there is something that you might have missed, but you’re too exhausted and decide to head back to the City of Sevgard, and return to the lodge some other day.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=After searching the lodge, your sharp eye noticed a hidden trapdoor on the floor. The door is made out of hard wood with iron ornaments. Your curiosity is still fueling you as you open the door and head down the old wooden stairs, into the root cellar. Suddenly you notice a loud shriek – it’s a rat! The rat charges at you, ready to sink its razor sharp teeth into your flesh. You hold on to your weapon and prepare for another fight!
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=Another foe slain as you move to further explore the cellar. To your surprise, and luck, the cellar was hiding several precious items, as you found {0}! Bright smile on your face concludes that the adventure was a success, and you start heading back to the City of Sevgard, happy that you found both treasures and new stories to tell at the inn.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Return to the City of Sevgard.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Search the lodge.

# Hermit in the cave exploration event
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=Thick fog surrounds the City of Sevgard as you walk past the city gates. Rumors of caves filled with various treasures, glorious artifacts of old and mythical weapons of heroes of legends drive you forth into exploring more of the enchanted Whispering Woods. Loud howls don’t inspire fear in you while venturing deep into the forest, trailblazing into the unknown, where no one else went – or at least never came back alive to tell the tale.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Suddenly you notice pale blue wisp, floating in the air. As you approach the magical creature, it seems like it’s playing in mid-air, and chuckling. As soon as you get close to it, it floats further away, and the chuckles become more and more vivid. “Come play with me! Catch me if you can!” it said. Deciding to play along, you follow the wisp, becoming more and more relaxed and unaware of your surroundings, slowly losing the sense of time. Through the thick fog, hop and a skip above a small creek, down the small ledge, the game went on. Speed of an experienced adventurer finally caught up with the wisp, and as soon as you grabbed it, it vanished, leaving you on a meadow surrounded by forest on all sides, and a cave on the north-west.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=While approaching the cave, you see an old man sitting in front of it, and he looks like he’s meditating. The Hermit notices you and starts mumbling something that you don’t understand. He looks thin and weak, his long grey beard tells you that he’s very old, while his eyes are dark – as if the Whispering Woods drained all his energy and emotions. Despite your friendly “Hello!” the old Hermit charges at you with his club. You tumble onto the ground, barely evading the hit, and prepare yourself for combat – the old man is a lot stronger than he looks!
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=“That crazy old man sure put up a fight! I didn’t know that old men can hit that hard!” you thought to yourself while drinking up a flask of bone regenerating potion, to help heal your left hand bone. It seems like it suffered a strong blow from the Hermit’s bludgeon. You look up and see the Hermit’s cave, and wonder what kinds of items the crazy old man hoarded.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=You decide to search the cave, which looks like it has been maintained daily! It resembles a very neat living space, with a comfortable bed, alchemist table and plenty of books, written on a language unknown to you. In the end of the cave is a gold plated wooden chest, locked with an iron padlock.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You could try to pick the lock, or smash the padlock with your weapon.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=Success! The padlock was no match for your lockpicking skills, and you found {0} inside the chest!
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=The padlock is too sturdy for your lockpicking skills. Still, your weapon can easily crush it.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=You smashed the padlock, and you found {0} but some items like {1} were crushed.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=Your hand suffered a hard blow, and it needs rest. Best decision is to head back to town, get some rest, and some food in your belly, and come to the cave some other time.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Search the cave (you will lose one movement point because of the injury).
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Go back to town.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_3=Pick the lock.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_4=Smash the padlock.

# Chasing the goblins exploration event
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=A familiar gate guardian face lets out a well-known “Take care, adventurer!” and a nod, as you walk past by the city gates. Even though the area is dangerous, most of the townsfolk know of your bravery and skills – which results in many job offerings. Nonetheless, you’re an adventurer, and accept no permanent job, for you find it boring, and it can’t calm the adventurous spirit of your being.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Down the treacherous path you wander, further exploring secrets of the woods. After suddenly hearing footsteps, you decide to rapidly dash towards the source of the sound. They are far too quiet to be human, and run on a far faster beat! Tearing up the branches, sliding through the bushes and finally you see the creature - a goblin! Just as suspected.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=“Prepare to meet your maker, Goblin scum!” you roared fiercely as you charged the creature. But instead the usual hissing and strange words on goblin tongue, the creature let out a loud shriek and fell on its back, trying to cover its face with tiny hands. As if that shock wasn’t enough, it spoke on common-world language, which was used by many races but not goblins:
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=“Please, have mercy! Don’t kill me! I didn’t do anything, I’m no warrior! I was just researching! Please don’t hurt me!”.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=“You speak our language? How is that possible?”, you answered, but still on your guard.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=“Yes! Instead of choosing the path of war, like many of my tribe folk, I chose the scholar’s way of life! I studied many races and languages, and began speaking the common-world language. Because of the way I chose, others bullied me and exiled me! So I’m wandering the forest alone, researching and learning many things! I recently discovered a glade with miraculous water, which can heal wounds! I can take you there, as a token of appreciation for not killing me. What do you say, friend?”.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=If he was a scholar, why did he need a sword he pulled out? Nonetheless, he’s dead now, researching forests and meadows in the realm of death. No Goblin is to be trusted, and they all deserve punishment.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=You cautiously followed the little Goblin separatist, while observing the surroundings. None of the paths seemed familiar, and each new part of the woods seemed more and more amazing. Finally, the small party of two arrived at the glade. Stunned by the beauty of the isolated glade, you watched as small birds and butterflies flew over the water that poured forth from the miraculous spring, while also noticing many new species of flowers and plants that you’ve never seen before.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=As you turned to the Goblin separatist, he let out a loud shriek and a fierce Goblin Guard, armed to his sharp, dirty teeth, charged towards you from the surrounding bushes!
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_10=Goblin Guard fell down, smitten by your mighty blows. But just as you thought to send the little tricky Goblin separatist to hell, another guard appeared. Tired, but not ready to give in, you prepare for another battle, while the hatred towards Goblin scum fueled your fists.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=Finally, the combat is over. Careful observing of the surroundings made you sure that there is no one else here but you and the Goblin separatist. “How could have I been tricked like this?!”  , you think to yourself. Your fists yearn for vengeance, but the rest of the body seems to be too tired to continue. The Goblin separatist looks as he is about to start running away after his plan failed.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_12=A look full of hatred thrown to the Goblin separatist tells him that this is not over just yet. As you turn around he starts running away. “Another time, Goblin. When we meet then, I’ll be prepared, and make sure that I send you to the realm of the dead!”, are the only thoughts in your head. Battled two Goblin Guards and won, but still can’t help the feeling of defeat – you swear that you’re never going to be tricked like that, as you’re making your way home.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_13=Being tired cannot stop you from killing the Goblin that dragged you into ambush. The trickster starts to run very fast back into the woods, and you follow him.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_14=Past combat with two Goblin Guards had much impact on your stamina. This time, you can’t keep up with the separatist. “Another time, Goblin. When we meet then, I’ll be prepared, and make sure that I send you to the realm of the dead!”, are the only thoughts in your head. Battled two Goblin Guards and won, but still can’t help the feeling of defeat – you swear that you’re never going to be tricked like that, as you’re making your way home.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_15=The creature ran, as fast as it could, through the thick bushes, thorny vines, over dead roots and branches, but nothing helped it. Finally, you had the separatist cornered. But, cornered beast is the most ferocious one. Goblin Separatist hissed, showing his teeth as he revealed a sword it had the whole time. Another combat begins!
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_16=Little treacherous creature lies dead. Exhausted and barely standing, you start heading back to the city, but relieved that you didn’t let the Goblin Separatist slip through unpunished for his treachery. Who knows how much trouble he could have caused if he trapped someone who is not such an experienced adventurer and can’t defend himself!
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_17=You draw your weapon, ready to face the vermin. To your surprise, the “scholar” has a sword! You fiercely charge the bastard who tried to trick you.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Kill the Goblin. They’re not to be trusted.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Follow the Goblin. After all, he’s just a bookworm, he can’t do much.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_3=Go home. You’re too tired for another battle.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_4=Attack the separatist. The little scum will pay!

# Goblin king exploration event
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The grape wine served at the inn was great that morning, and you enjoyed the flavor, sipping it slowly.  There’s been a strange atmosphere in the town lately. Some soldiers went missing, and some witnesses saw an Orc-like creature dragging them away and killing them. Orcs have been attacked on the streets, even though some of them serve Sevgard as valiant soldiers. In the middle of your wine tasting enjoyment the inn door opens wide, with a loud bash, as two wounded soldiers collapse on the floor. They’re scared to death, mauled and heavily wounded. A nurse that happened to be having breakfast at the inn hurries to help them. You can’t approach them as the crowd is too thick, but you hear them say several words: attacked, friends slaughtered, great goblin. Without hesitation, you rush outside. Fury and anger engulf your mind. “If that 'Great Goblin' resides in the forest, he may be responsible for all the attacks on Sevgard and nearby homes. Time to pay, bastard!” are the only thoughts in your head.
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Following the footsteps of city guard patrol, you venture deep into the forest. “So many footsteps go into the forest… So few return… I’m going to end this!” .
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=After half a day of tracking the footsteps, you find a bloody scenery. Smashed parts of armor, half eaten bits of flesh, broken weapons. A pile of corpses of Sevgardian soldiers as well as some goblin corpses. You turn to the right and notice smoke nearby. Sneaking up to the source of the smoke and climbing a small ledge you see an enormous goblin standing next to a fire. The beast is cooking an elk, so it seems that killing citizens of Sevgard is just for fun, not for the actual food. This angers you, but you take a closer look at the huge goblin. It’s a bit taller than an average orc, his body muscular and strong, his skin looks hard to pierce, but it’s scarred, as it encountered other adventurers and Sevgard soldiers before. Killing this thing will be tough, but the people of Sevgard will not be safe until the monstrosity is slain.
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=The Goblin king will pay, but not today. You sense that his power is way greater than yours, so you decide to retreat for now. The road back to Sevgard is long, probably because of all the thoughts of innocent people slain by the beast, but you cannot do anything about it now. The sense of helplessness drives you to become stronger, to protect the weak and to finally slay the King of Goblins.
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=You let out a deep sigh as you draw your weapon. This might be your biggest challenge yet! “For Sevgard!” you shout, as you jump from the ledge onto the King of the Goblins!
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You won! You triumphed over the sadistic beast and fall down on the ground. The battle was fierce, his skin was thicker than any armor, his blows were hard, and his speed was surprisingly great. It took most of your energy and now you need to rest. Kneeling beside the enormous corpse is very unsatisfying, but you just can’t find the strength to move. You noticed several goblins surround you, but they keep their distance. Their master was slain by a stronger warrior and they show their anger by letting out loud shrieks and showing their teeth. They're moving in, inch by inch. The anger in you is not enough to regain your energy, you are still kneeling. You grab your weapon, and shout: “Come on, you scum! I’ve killed your master! You’re no match for me! Come on! Let’s end this! For Sevgard!”. Your screams of fury are not enough to scare the goblins away, but they have another effect, something you were not aware of – Sevgard’s cavalry rode for the forest after the guards at the gate saw you rushing to track down the Goblin King. They heard your screams and rode swiftly to your aid. After hearing the sound of Sevgardian war horses, you gather all the strength you have left to raise your weapon high, and shout “Victory!” before collapsing on the ground.
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=The goblins were no match for the finest riders of Sevgard and were quickly dealt with. The town guards took you back to the Sevgard inn to recover.
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=After your recovery a feast is held in your honor, as you are once again hailed as the Hero of Sevgard!
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Attack (Warning! You’re about to attack a Boss! Boss creatures are extremely difficult to kill!)
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Go back home.

# Feast of a ghoul exploration event
FEAST_OF_A_GHOUL_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=After a good dinner when sleep still doesn’t come to you, you decide to go seek some adventure in the woods and your steps lead you to the ancient cemetery. You hear the sound of crunching bones and loud chewing just a few steps from the gate. You go to investigate the source of the sound and find something truly terrifying. In front of you there is a man-like creature with dark grey skin crouched over a dead body and gnawing on its ribcage.
FEAST_OF_A_GHOUL_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=The dead body, as you now realized, probably belonged to some other adventurer just like you, at least as far as you can tell from his leather armour and a broken longbow lying next to him.
FEAST_OF_A_GHOUL_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=You try to creep closer for a silent kill but the creature suddenly stops feasting and sniffs the air. After a couple of sharp breaths it turns its head to you and you recognise a ghoul. The ghouls eyes lock on you like the eyes of a predator as it pulls back its lips to show you two lines of crooked canines still glistening with the blood of its prey and already hungry for more.
FEAST_OF_A_GHOUL_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=The ghoul charges at you with long steps that are surprisingly fast and with its claws up, ready to tear your head off. In the last second you manage to grab your weapon to defend yourself.
FEAST_OF_A_GHOUL_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=After your victory you approach the dead adventurer. His stomach is torn open but his pouch is still intact. He won’t be needing it anymore, so you decide to take it.

# Mad mage exploration event
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=As you’re wandering through the Wispering Woods your path leads you straight to the Cemetery. You decide to make a little round trip in hopes of finding some buried treasure or at least getting to know the place better. You walk along the wall trying to decipher some of the names on the tombstones but have no such luck since the gravestones are all so weathered it’s a wonder they stand at all, let alone being legible.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=After going halfway around the cemetery you notice a small shack huddled beside the cemetery wall with smoke coming out through cracks in the roof. As you come closer you notice a broken section of the wall of the cemetery and climb over the ruins. You approach the shack and knock. The door slowly opens inwards, creaking on rusty hinges, revealing a view of a person showing you their back and dressed in a dark cloak and a cape over their head so there is no way to know the person‘s gender. They are hunched over a cauldron hanging above a fireplace. There’s no telling wether the cauldon contains a soup or a potion but just the smell makes you think you would never drink it even if it was the only thing, that could save you from dying.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=„What is it?“ the stranger asks impatiently and turns to face you. Before you stands a man with a raspy voice, pale face and the darkest eyes you’ve ever seen. They are as black as the deepest pit and their whites are riddled with dark veins.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=„Oh, another dark mage hunter, are you? At least I won’t have to work with those centuries old rotten bodies,“ he says as he prepares a spell.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=As the mages black eyes turn blank and his blood makes a dark red puddle around him, you notice a trapdoor in the corner. You open it and find a ladder leading down into darkness.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=It’s too dark down there for you to see anything so you just close the trapoor and return to Sevgard.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=You take out your torch and light it in the fireplace before going down. You enter a cellar too big for the hut above and full of tables with bodies in different levels of dissection. You turn away from the bodies and see what must be the dead mage’s work desk. You quickly search through its contents and find [LIST_OF_DROPS]. With your pouch full of loot you climb up from the cellar, trying not to look at the dissected corpses, and return to Sevgard.
