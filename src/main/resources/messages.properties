# Forest journey exploration event
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The patrons of the Drunken Dragoon told you strange stories about the Whispering Wood last night, and it sparked your curiosity. Were the stories true? Could you actually hear whispers? You travel to the forest edge and listen for a few moments. The breeze blew by and rustles the leaves, and then, all goes silent. You take a deep breath and squeeze your eyes shut to help you focus. Just faintly, there is a voice...no voices. They are soft and so, so gentle - beckoning to you. What are they saying?
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=You venture into the forest despite the warning signs. The whispers are growing louder and fighting to be heard. A chorus of disjointed thoughts surrounds you. The whispers persist until their message melds together. They come from no singular place. They are everywhere and closing in fast. You spin in a slow circle and struggle to understand them. What are they saying?!
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=An eerie shriek startles you, and a Goblin Guard drops from a tree. You dodge the creature's oncoming attack and hurry to protect yourself.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=As soon as you defeat the Goblin Guard, rapid footsteps crash through the undergrowth. The wild grass shakes as another Goblin Guard bursts from the foliage. He withdraws his weapon and senses your presence.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=There might be more of them! You sprint toward a thicket and conceal yourself. The Goblin Guard discovers his fallen comrade and snarls angrily, baring his crooked teeth. His yellow gaze sweeps over your hiding place, and you cover your mouth, struggling to keep quiet. His suspicions turn elsewhere which gives you an opportunity to strike!
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You slay the Goblin Guard before he can alert his tribemates. You back away from the bodies and retreat to Farmfields.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=There might be more of them! You sprint toward a thicket and conceal yourself. The Goblin Guard discovers his fallen comrade and snarls angrily, baring his crooked teeth. His yellow gaze sweeps over your hiding place, and he sees you! You abandon the thicket as more Goblins appear. Their enraged shrieks haunt you until you escape the forest. Beware of goblins. They travel in packs.

# Robbing the Chieftains exploration event
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1="Adventurer, we need your help! A goblin tribe lurks deep in the Whispering Wood, and they've been attacking innocent travelers. We're under orders to remain in Sevgard. Warn the farmers! Keep them safe!" a desperate guard insists.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=You have encountered these goblins in the past. They aggressively slaughter livestock and destroy precious crops. These goblins must be stopped before they harm anyone else. "I'll find the goblins myself," you assure.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=Departing the guard post, you march straight to the forest and plan to eliminate the goblins once and for all. You bypass the main path and discover a thick trail of blood leading into the foliage. It appears the goblins snagged another farm animal, dragging it ruthlessly away. The crimson droplets provide a direct course to the goblin camp. As you draw nearer, you struggle to navigate dense, spider-webbing roots, extending from a massive, sickly tree. Gnarled knots protrude from the hollow oak, and dark sap oozes from its wounds. You crouch behind a cluster of hanging roots and notice a pig roasting above a cookfire. You count the goblins patrolling the camp. If you sneak closer, you might be able to catch them by surprise.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=You take a deep breath and inch forward slowly. The hanging roots conceal your position, and you sneak to the opposing side of the camp. A large tent rests in front of you and may contain valuable loot. You remove a dagger from your belt and cut a hole in the fabric. You tear the tent open softly and crawl inside. A blanket covers an elaborate bone chest, and you reach to open it. However, the chest is tightly locked. You shake the chest persistently just as the Goblin Chieftain enters his tent. He drops his pork haunch in surprise and screeches before charging you.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=You kill the Goblin Chieftain and discover an ebony key hanging from his belt. You unlock the chest and receive {0}. You hear enraged shrieks from the other side of the clearing and hurriedly collect your loot. You scramble away from the tent and sprint into the forest. The goblins do not follow you. They are too busy mourning the death of their chieftain. You return to Sevard to report to the guards.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You take a deep breath and sprint toward a mossy rock. You slide behind it and peek slowly at the patrolling Goblin Guards. Before you can regain your bearings, dirt clumps fling against you. You whirl around and come face to face with a frantic Goblin Guard. He was already hiding here and burying his loot! The Goblin Guard curses loudly and attacks you.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=The Goblin Guard squeals and collapses on his partially buried loot. You freeze when a series of shrieks erupts from behind the rock. Not good! You forsake your plan and flee from the goblin camp. Angering a goblin tribe isn't worth it - not today at least.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=**You gained {0}.**

# Wolf attack exploration event
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=A local leatherworker requires wolf pelts for the upcoming winter season, and he enlists you for the job. You depart for the forest immediately and discover a set of wolf tracks along the path. During the night, the wolves creep out of their dens and devour unattended livestock, and as a result, an elite hunting guild formed. Hunting parties enter the forest daily, yet the wolf population refuses to dwindle. This greatly benefits Sevgard and the master leatherworkers who craft for the kingdom. However, their prices can be quite steep, so you're willing to assist a local who cannot afford quality fur.
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=The wolf tracks divert from the path and lead deep into the foliage. You move slowly and watch where you step. Hunters litter the ground with traps and forget to retrieve them. You imagine steel teeth snapping through your ankle and trapping you in place. The scent of blood would attract predators, and they would devour you alive. The thought disturbs you. Just last week, a farmhand drifted off the path to collect flowers and stepped directly into a bear trap. Now, he hobbles around Farmfields on a pair of crutches. He's still lucky to have his foot!
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=A dark, brown wolf bears his teeth and rises from the undergrowth. He must have been sleeping! The beast shifts into a crouch before pouncing.
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=You kill the wolf and drag its body further into the clearing. While you were fighting, night fell and plunged your surroundings into darkness. It's unsafe to trek home, so you decide to make camp. You construct a campfire and set up your tent before returning to the wolf's body. You remove a knife from your belt and begin skinning the pelt from the creature. A series of howls alarms you. With horror, you notice glowing eyes surrounding the clearing. You snatch a burning stick from the fire and wave it in front of you. The wolves snarl and prowl in a circle, but they never drift closer. You relax and scoot over to the fire. This would be a long night.
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=By dawn, the wolves lose interest and fade into the forest. You pack up camp and return to the leatherworker.

# Woodcutters exploration event
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=While exploring the forest, you notice tendrils of smoke rising above the treetops. You push through fronds and step onto a man-made path. Wagon and horse tracks engrave the path and lead to a steady, chopping sound. Cautiously, you abandon your cover and approach a crowd of stumps and woodchips. A campfire roars a few feet away with firewood nestled beside it. Several carts border the camp with gigantic logs loaded inro the back. A tawny horse studies you before grazing in a nearby meadow. It's only a woodcutting camp. That's a relief.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2="Adventurer, you can join us for supper if you help us. There's only four trees left," a strong woodcutter insists.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=You leave the shadows and grab an ax embedded in a stump. You cross to the closest tree and adjust your grip. Bending your knees, you swing the ax and hear it crunch into the trunk. You remove the ax and swing again. You fall into a rhythm and chop away at the rough bark. When you reach halfway, a woodcutter joins you, and you make quick work of the tree. With a mighty moan, the great oak topples to the ground and joins a pile of felled trees. You move onto the next tree until the job is complete.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=By now, you're sweaty, sore, and exhausted. The woodcutters gather around the fire and discuss recipes. They decide on lasagna, but none of them possess cooking skills. You offer to assist them, and within the hour, everyone is enjoying a delicious meal. Upon finishing, you crawl into a nearby tent and fall asleep with a warm belly.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=The woodcutters wake at dawn and prepare the logs for shipping. Leftover breakfast brews in the cauldron, and you help yourself. The head woodcutter thanks you and offers you {0} Bronze coins as a parting gift. You gratefully accept the gift and bid all of the woodcutters goodbye.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=**You gained {0} Bronze Coins.**

# The Inn exploration event
THE_INN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=You stand up and draw the attention of a pale green Orc Brigand. He sneers at you with his crooked teeth and removes a sharp dagger from his leather belt. You return his glare and prepare yourself for a fight.

# River Cave Deja Vu exploration event
RIVER_CAVE_DEJA_VU_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=On the other side, you notice clusters of clay pots and urns with bronze coins scattered around them. However, you are not alone. A Goblin Piker sits crisscross in the middle of the room and seems to be meditating. His formidable pike rests across his lap with his green fingers clasped tightly around it. You debate on returning whence you came though an urn rests only a few feet away. As you pick it up, it slips straight from your grasp due to a thick coating of slime. The urn shatters and alerts the Goblin Piker. He snarls at you and raises his sharp pike.

# One bandit is no bandit exploration event
ONE_BANDIT_IS_NO_BANDIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=In the morning, you pack a bag with sufficient supplies and leave Sevgard. You approach Farmfields and recall the path to Pete the Farmer's home. You plan on offering your services to the farmer, and hopefully, he would lower his pride and accept your offer. You daydream about fresh vegetables and meats but halt when you notice a dark figure ahead of you. A Bandit Brigand wearing all black leans against a wooden post and tosses a dagger up and down, catching it perfectly by the hilt. He notices you and snickers beneath a crimson bandana. He sprints toward you, giving you barely enough time to react.

# The bridge exploration event
THE_BRIDGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The Goblin Guard crouches next to a cook fire, and he turns a crudely constructed spit. A skinned rat spins slowly with its long tail dipping into the flames. The rat tail burns off, and with gnashing teeth, the Goblin Guard snatches it from the embers and shoves it into his mouth. He struggles to eat the rubbery tail but seems to be enjoying the taste. The Goblin Guard turns to prep another rat when he notices you standing in the river. He shrieks furiously and attacks you.

# Cave at the river exploration event
CAVE_AT_THE_RIVER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=A rock formation rests to your left, and you notice an opening to a large den. Upon closer inspection, there are piles of small animal bones scattered around the entrance along with pawprints. You stiffen as you hear a muffled growl from behind you. You turn slowly and see a {0} with a silver fish clenched in its jaws. The {0} drops the fish and charges you aggressively.

# Goblin raiding party exploration event
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The Goblin Pikeman falls to the ground, and you whirl around. You caught the first Goblin Pikemen off guard, but the rest of them are ready.
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=The Goblin Shaman falls to the ground. You glare at the remainder. You are about to attack when you realize the goblins are running away. Cowards! You sprint after them, but they have a head start. The goblins disappear into the woods like rats, and it is impossible to follow them. You retreat to the farmer and describe the situation. You insist on staying the night in case the goblins return, and for your trouble, the farmer gives you a pouch of bronze coins.
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=You promise the goblins will be dead by nightfall and leave the farm promptly. The hills are a stone throw away, and you even see smoke rising from a cook fire. These goblins have become arrogant. It is the middle of the day! You trek up a slope and notice a goblin encampment with bones strewn everywhere. It seems like they have been gorging themselves. With an enraged cry, you charge down the hill and attack a Goblin Pikeman.

# Abandoned hunting lodge exploration event
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=After a long day of rest, you decide to further explore the Whispering Woods. Treacherous paths, covered with leaves, moss and wild animal footprints can leave you to most unexpected places. As you’re making your way through thick forest, you see a strange light coming from the north east. Adventure spirit within your heart leads you to the source of the light – an abandoned hunting lodge. You circle around the lodge, and see that it’s very preserved, but overgrown in vines and moss.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Curiosity drives you forward, and you decide to enter the lodge. As soon as you opened the door, a Gnoll sees you and draws his weapon and charges you. Gnolls are vicious, territorial and very fast – you cannot outrun it, so you draw your weapon and prepare for a fight!
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=The battle was fierce, but the vicious creature stood no chance against you. As the Gnoll tumbled down the stairs at the lodge entrance, releasing the last shriek of pain, you enter the cabin. You look around the lodge and consider trying to search for any treasures that Gnoll might have collected.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=The battle drew too much of your strength. You decide to leave the lodge for now, as you might need all the strength you can get on your way home – you never know what lurks in the forest, and watches over passengers, their potential prey.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=After spending some time searching the lodge, you fail to find anything of use to you.  You can’t help but feel that there is something that you might have missed, but you’re too exhausted and decide to head back to the City of Sevgard, and return to the lodge some other day.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=After searching the lodge, your sharp eye noticed a hidden trapdoor on the floor. The door is made out of hard wood with iron ornaments. Your curiosity is still fueling you as you open the door and head down the old wooden stairs, into the root cellar. Suddenly you notice a loud shriek – it’s a rat! The rat charges at you, ready to sink its razor sharp teeth into your flesh. You hold on to your weapon and prepare for another fight!
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=Another foe slain as you move to further explore the cellar. To your surprise, and luck, the cellar was hiding several precious items, as you found {0}! Bright smile on your face concludes that the adventure was a success, and you start heading back to the City of Sevgard, happy that you found both treasures and new stories to tell at the inn.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Return to the City of Sevgard.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Search the lodge.

# Hermit in the cave exploration event
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=Thick fog surrounds the City of Sevgard as you walk past the city gates. Rumors of caves filled with various treasures, glorious artifacts of old and mythical weapons of heroes of legends drive you forth into exploring more of the enchanted Whispering Woods. Loud howls don’t inspire fear in you while venturing deep into the forest, trailblazing into the unknown, where no one else went – or at least never came back alive to tell the tale.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Suddenly you notice pale blue wisp, floating in the air. As you approach the magical creature, it seems like it’s playing in mid-air, and chuckling. As soon as you get close to it, it floats further away, and the chuckles become more and more vivid. “Come play with me! Catch me if you can!” it said. Deciding to play along, you follow the wisp, becoming more and more relaxed and unaware of your surroundings, slowly losing the sense of time. Through the thick fog, hop and a skip above a small creek, down the small ledge, the game went on. Speed of an experienced adventurer finally caught up with the wisp, and as soon as you grabbed it, it vanished, leaving you on a meadow surrounded by forest on all sides, and a cave on the north-west.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=While approaching the cave, you see an old man sitting in front of it, and he looks like he’s meditating. The Hermit notices you and starts mumbling something that you don’t understand. He looks thin and weak, his long grey beard tells you that he’s very old, while his eyes are dark – as if the Whispering Woods drained all his energy and emotions. Despite your friendly “Hello!” the old Hermit charges at you with his club. You tumble onto the ground, barely evading the hit, and prepare yourself for combat – the old man is a lot stronger than he looks!
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=“That crazy old man sure put up a fight! I didn’t know that old men can hit that hard!” you thought to yourself while drinking up a flask of bone regenerating potion, to help heal your left hand bone. It seems like it suffered a strong blow from the Hermit’s bludgeon. You look up and see the Hermit’s cave, and wonder what kinds of items the crazy old man hoarded.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=You decide to search the cave, which looks like it has been maintained daily! It resembles a very neat living space, with a comfortable bed, alchemist table and plenty of books, written on a language unknown to you. In the end of the cave is a gold plated wooden chest, locked with an iron padlock.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You could try to pick the lock, or smash the padlock with your weapon.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=Success! The padlock was no match for your lockpicking skills, and you found [LOOTHERE] inside the chest!
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=The padlock is too sturdy for your lockpicking skills. Still, your weapon can easily crush it.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=You smashed the padlock, and you found [LOOTHERE], but some items like [LOOTHERE] were crushed.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=Your hand suffered a hard blow, and it needs rest. Best decision is to head back to town, get some rest, and some food in your belly, and come to the cave some other time.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Search the cave (you will lose one movement point because of the injury).
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Go back to town.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_3=Pick the lock.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_4=Smash the padlock.
