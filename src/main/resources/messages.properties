# Forest journey exploration event
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The patrons of the Drunken Dragoon told you strange stories about the Whispering Wood last night, and it sparked your curiosity. Were the stories true? Could you actually hear whispers? You travel to the forest edge and listen for a few moments. The breeze blew by and rustles the leaves, and then, all goes silent. You take a deep breath and squeeze your eyes shut to help you focus. Just faintly, there is a voice...no voices. They are soft and so, so gentle - beckoning to you. What are they saying?
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=You venture into the forest despite the warning signs. The whispers are growing louder and fighting to be heard. A chorus of disjointed thoughts surrounds you. The whispers persist until their message melds together. They come from no singular place. They are everywhere and closing in fast. You spin in a slow circle and struggle to understand them. What are they saying?!
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=An eerie shriek startles you, and a Goblin Guard drops from a tree. You dodge the creature's oncoming attack and hurry to protect yourself.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=As soon as you defeat the Goblin Guard, rapid footsteps crash through the undergrowth. The wild grass shakes as another Goblin Guard bursts from the foliage. He withdraws his weapon and senses your presence.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=There might be more of them! You sprint toward a thicket and conceal yourself. The Goblin Guard discovers his fallen comrade and snarls angrily, baring his crooked teeth. His yellow gaze sweeps over your hiding place, and you cover your mouth, struggling to keep quiet. His suspicions turn elsewhere which gives you an opportunity to strike!
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You slay the Goblin Guard before he can alert his tribemates. You back away from the bodies and retreat to Farmfields.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=There might be more of them! You sprint toward a thicket and conceal yourself. The Goblin Guard discovers his fallen comrade and snarls angrily, baring his crooked teeth. His yellow gaze sweeps over your hiding place, and he sees you! You abandon the thicket as more Goblins appear. Their enraged shrieks haunt you until you escape the forest. Beware of goblins. They travel in packs.
