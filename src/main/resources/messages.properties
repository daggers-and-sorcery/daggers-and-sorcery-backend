# Forest journey exploration event
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The patrons of the Drunken Dragoon told you strange stories about the Whispering Wood last night, and it sparked your curiosity. Were the stories true? Could you actually hear whispers? You travel to the forest edge and listen for a few moments. The breeze blew by and rustles the leaves, and then, all goes silent. You take a deep breath and squeeze your eyes shut to help you focus. Just faintly, there is a voice...no voices. They are soft and so, so gentle - beckoning to you. What are they saying?
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=You venture into the forest despite the warning signs. The whispers are growing louder and fighting to be heard. A chorus of disjointed thoughts surrounds you. The whispers persist until their message melds together. They come from no singular place. They are everywhere and closing in fast. You spin in a slow circle and struggle to understand them. What are they saying?!
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=An eerie shriek startles you, and a Goblin Guard drops from a tree. You dodge the creature's oncoming attack and hurry to protect yourself.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=As soon as you defeat the Goblin Guard, rapid footsteps crash through the undergrowth. The wild grass shakes as another Goblin Guard bursts from the foliage. He withdraws his weapon and senses your presence.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=There might be more of them! You sprint toward a thicket and conceal yourself. The Goblin Guard discovers his fallen comrade and snarls angrily, baring his crooked teeth. His yellow gaze sweeps over your hiding place, and you cover your mouth, struggling to keep quiet. His suspicions turn elsewhere which gives you an opportunity to strike!
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You slay the Goblin Guard before he can alert his tribemates. You back away from the bodies and retreat to Farmfields.
FOREST_JOURNEY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=There might be more of them! You sprint toward a thicket and conceal yourself. The Goblin Guard discovers his fallen comrade and snarls angrily, baring his crooked teeth. His yellow gaze sweeps over your hiding place, and he sees you! You abandon the thicket as more Goblins appear. Their enraged shrieks haunt you until you escape the forest. Beware of goblins. They travel in packs.

# Robbing the Chieftains exploration event
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1="Adventurer, we need your help! A goblin tribe lurks deep in the Whispering Wood, and they've been attacking innocent travelers. We're under orders to remain in Sevgard. Warn the farmers! Keep them safe!" a desperate guard insists.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=You have encountered these goblins in the past. They aggressively slaughter livestock and destroy precious crops. These goblins must be stopped before they harm anyone else. "I'll find the goblins myself," you assure.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=Departing the guard post, you march straight to the forest and plan to eliminate the goblins once and for all. You bypass the main path and discover a thick trail of blood leading into the foliage. It appears the goblins snagged another farm animal, dragging it ruthlessly away. The crimson droplets provide a direct course to the goblin camp. As you draw nearer, you struggle to navigate dense, spider-webbing roots, extending from a massive, sickly tree. Gnarled knots protrude from the hollow oak, and dark sap oozes from its wounds. You crouch behind a cluster of hanging roots and notice a pig roasting above a cookfire. You count the goblins patrolling the camp. If you sneak closer, you might be able to catch them by surprise.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=You take a deep breath and inch forward slowly. The hanging roots conceal your position, and you sneak to the opposing side of the camp. A large tent rests in front of you and may contain valuable loot. You remove a dagger from your belt and cut a hole in the fabric. You tear the tent open softly and crawl inside. A blanket covers an elaborate bone chest, and you reach to open it. However, the chest is tightly locked. You shake the chest persistently just as the Goblin Chieftain enters his tent. He drops his pork haunch in surprise and screeches before charging you.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=You kill the Goblin Chieftain and discover an ebony key hanging from his belt. You unlock the chest and receive {0}. You hear enraged shrieks from the other side of the clearing and hurriedly collect your loot. You scramble away from the tent and sprint into the forest. The goblins do not follow you. They are too busy mourning the death of their chieftain. You return to Sevard to report to the guards.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You take a deep breath and sprint toward a mossy rock. You slide behind it and peek slowly at the patrolling Goblin Guards. Before you can regain your bearings, dirt clumps fling against you. You whirl around and come face to face with a frantic Goblin Guard. He was already hiding here and burying his loot! The Goblin Guard curses loudly and attacks you.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=The Goblin Guard squeals and collapses on his partially buried loot. You freeze when a series of shrieks erupts from behind the rock. Not good! You forsake your plan and flee from the goblin camp. Angering a goblin tribe isn't worth it - not today at least.
ROBBING_THE_CHIEFTAIN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=**You gained {0}.**

# Wolf attack exploration event
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=A local leatherworker requires wolf pelts for the upcoming winter season, and he enlists you for the job. You depart for the forest immediately and discover a set of wolf tracks along the path. During the night, the wolves creep out of their dens and devour unattended livestock, and as a result, an elite hunting guild formed. Hunting parties enter the forest daily, yet the wolf population refuses to dwindle. This greatly benefits Sevgard and the master leatherworkers who craft for the kingdom. However, their prices can be quite steep, so you're willing to assist a local who cannot afford quality fur.
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=The wolf tracks divert from the path and lead deep into the foliage. You move slowly and watch where you step. Hunters litter the ground with traps and forget to retrieve them. You imagine steel teeth snapping through your ankle and trapping you in place. The scent of blood would attract predators, and they would devour you alive. The thought disturbs you. Just last week, a farmhand drifted off the path to collect flowers and stepped directly into a bear trap. Now, he hobbles around Farmfields on a pair of crutches. He's still lucky to have his foot!
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=A dark, brown wolf bears his teeth and rises from the undergrowth. He must have been sleeping! The beast shifts into a crouch before pouncing.
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=You kill the wolf and drag its body further into the clearing. While you were fighting, night fell and plunged your surroundings into darkness. It's unsafe to trek home, so you decide to make camp. You construct a campfire and set up your tent before returning to the wolf's body. You remove a knife from your belt and begin skinning the pelt from the creature. A series of howls alarms you. With horror, you notice glowing eyes surrounding the clearing. You snatch a burning stick from the fire and wave it in front of you. The wolves snarl and prowl in a circle, but they never drift closer. You relax and scoot over to the fire. This would be a long night.
WOLF_ATTACK_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=By dawn, the wolves lose interest and fade into the forest. You pack up camp and return to the leatherworker.

# Woodcutters exploration event
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=While exploring the forest, you notice tendrils of smoke rising above the treetops. You push through fronds and step onto a man-made path. Wagon and horse tracks engrave the path and lead to a steady, chopping sound. Cautiously, you abandon your cover and approach a crowd of stumps and woodchips. A campfire roars a few feet away with firewood nestled beside it. Several carts border the camp with gigantic logs loaded inro the back. A tawny horse studies you before grazing in a nearby meadow. It's only a woodcutting camp. That's a relief.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2="Adventurer, you can join us for supper if you help us. There's only four trees left," a strong woodcutter insists.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=You leave the shadows and grab an ax embedded in a stump. You cross to the closest tree and adjust your grip. Bending your knees, you swing the ax and hear it crunch into the trunk. You remove the ax and swing again. You fall into a rhythm and chop away at the rough bark. When you reach halfway, a woodcutter joins you, and you make quick work of the tree. With a mighty moan, the great oak topples to the ground and joins a pile of felled trees. You move onto the next tree until the job is complete.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=By now, you're sweaty, sore, and exhausted. The woodcutters gather around the fire and discuss recipes. They decide on lasagna, but none of them possess cooking skills. You offer to assist them, and within the hour, everyone is enjoying a delicious meal. Upon finishing, you crawl into a nearby tent and fall asleep with a warm belly.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=The woodcutters wake at dawn and prepare the logs for shipping. Leftover breakfast brews in the cauldron, and you help yourself. The head woodcutter thanks you and offers you {0} Bronze coins as a parting gift. You gratefully accept the gift and bid all of the woodcutters goodbye.
WOODCUTTERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=**You gained {0} Bronze Coins.**

# Under a boulder exploration event
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=Sun was sending its rays shyly through branches of the Whispering Woods as you were trailblazing through the unknown yet again. Determination to map the whole forest keeps you up and running, while various treasures you find are just a material reward – your true reward are adventures. Lost in thoughts about you being named the greatest explorer of the Whispering Woods, your name written in all geographical books, you were unaware of a boulder beneath your feet – it was high enough to touch your knees, yet you fell over it, hitting the nearby grass.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Standing up, a bit angry, you noticed a big hole near the boulder. Tracks in the grass and dirt indicate that the boulder was used to cover the hole. The bottom of the hole cannot be seen, the interior is pitch black. You swiftly grab your backpack to see if you have any torch and a rope – the more you see down there, the better you’ll be prepared for whatever awaits you.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=“Damn, I forgot my torch and rope! I better head back to town to grab them. All the battle expertise is of no use if I can’t see a damn thing.”
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=“There they are! Time for some underground exploring!”
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=A tight knot on the rope, tied around the boulder, secured it. You double checked it – better safe than sorry! Torch lit and held in right hand, you descend. Judging by descending speed and duration, the hole is approximately 4 meters deep, and you instantly thank your good decision to bring torch and rope with you. The fall would definitely hurt, but what would’ve killed you were the traps on the bottom – you counted 23 sharp, 30 centimeters long, blade edges. There’s another rope, hanging on the ceiling of the underground cave, which enabled the passing of the trap. After about two minutes of walk you noticed that the cave is lit with torches, which were hanging on walls. The cave walls seem old but pretty solid, with some runes here and there. After more walking, you encounter a branching – one path leads left, and the other leads right.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=Something drew you to choose the right path. You walked cautiously and slowly, but you suddenly heard footsteps. There’s someone else here!
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=“Maybe he, or she, is peaceful? The trap’s for… Bears, goblins and other creatures, maybe?”.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=Staying optimistic, however, didn’t pay off. Right before your eyes was a smuggler, and the cave was his secret stash. It didn’t take much for the agile smuggler to notice you.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=“Not many have found this place. But none of them lived to tell the tale of my hideout” smuggler said.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_10=“I’m guessing these are not rightfully yours”, you replied arrogantly, and added: “I’ll do you a favor, bring them back to the citizens of Sevgard. After all, I’m a good Samaritan, and don’t want you to hurt your back or something. Give these goods back peacefully, and I’ll let you live, and give you a chance for a fair trial. Deal?”
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=The smuggler arrogantly laughed as he pulled a long curved blade from sheath. “Mwahaha, I don’t know if you’re too courageous or too stupid. Either way, you’re going to die. Pity, really, I kind of started to like you” he said as he charged towards you.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_12=“He’s so hotheaded and full of that ignorant pride. Time to show him why bullying the weak is not the way.” You thought to yourself as you grabbed your weapon and prepared to fend the attacker.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_13=“His tongue was sharper than his blade, and his ignorance was far greater than his battle prowess. Time to see what we have in these chests!” were your first thoughts after defeating the ignorant bandit. Smuggler’s mauled body was lying next to wooden boxes and linen sacks, which you looted and found {0}.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_14=You grabbed as many antiques as you could, and rushed to the other side of the cave, to check what’s hidden there, but were unpleasantly surprised as you saw that the wall has collapsed.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_15=“Ah, well. This is still better than nothing. I know these sigils on these antiques, and know to which house they belong. Owners will be happy to see them again in their hands!” you said and rushed to the exit. If one wall collapsed, whole cave could as well!
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_16=After a long walk, you enjoyed praises as you returned the stolen belongings to the rightful owners, and got rewarded nicely. You drank and ate for free, got {0} silver coins for your valiant effort, and shared your experience with other adventurers and townsfolk. In their hearts, you’re a hero, protector and inspiration!
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_17=Left side is first, so you chose it. It didn’t take long for you to come by a whole lot of boxes, chests and some sacks. “This has to be a hideout of a smuggler! Let’s see what we have here”  you thought to yourself while starting to loot all the chests. You’ve found {0}, and many antiques.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_18=“I recognize sigils on these antiques! This one belongs to the House of Wolfthorn, while this one belongs to the House of Elleos! They must be worth a lot of gold on the black market. I’ll return them to their rightful owners!”  you thought as you grabbed as many antiques as you could, and then rushed to the other side of the cave, to check what is hidden there, but were unpleasantly surprised as you saw that the wall has collapsed.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_19=“Ah, well. This is still better than nothing. I know these sigils on these antiques, and know to which house they belong. Owners will be happy to see them again in their hands!” you said and rushed to the exit. If one wall collapsed, whole cave could as well!
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_20=After a long walk, you enjoyed praises as you returned the stolen belongings to the rightful owners, and got rewarded nicely. You drank and ate for free, got {0} silver coins and shared your experience with other adventurers and townsfolk. In their hearts, you’re a hero, protector and inspiration!
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Go on the right path.
UNDER_A_BOULDER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Go on the left path.

# The Inn exploration event
THE_INN_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=You stand up and draw the attention of a pale green Orc Brigand. He sneers at you with his crooked teeth and removes a sharp dagger from his leather belt. You return his glare and prepare yourself for a fight.

# River Cave Deja Vu exploration event
RIVER_CAVE_DEJA_VU_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=On the other side, you notice clusters of clay pots and urns with bronze coins scattered around them. However, you are not alone. A Goblin Piker sits crisscross in the middle of the room and seems to be meditating. His formidable pike rests across his lap with his green fingers clasped tightly around it. You debate on returning whence you came though an urn rests only a few feet away. As you pick it up, it slips straight from your grasp due to a thick coating of slime. The urn shatters and alerts the Goblin Piker. He snarls at you and raises his sharp pike.

# One bandit is no bandit exploration event
ONE_BANDIT_IS_NO_BANDIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=In the morning, you pack a bag with sufficient supplies and leave Sevgard. You approach Farmfields and recall the path to Pete the Farmer's home. You plan on offering your services to the farmer, and hopefully, he would lower his pride and accept your offer. You daydream about fresh vegetables and meats but halt when you notice a dark figure ahead of you. A Bandit Brigand wearing all black leans against a wooden post and tosses a dagger up and down, catching it perfectly by the hilt. He notices you and snickers beneath a crimson bandana. He sprints toward you, giving you barely enough time to react.

# The bridge exploration event
THE_BRIDGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The Goblin Guard crouches next to a cook fire, and he turns a crudely constructed spit. A skinned rat spins slowly with its long tail dipping into the flames. The rat tail burns off, and with gnashing teeth, the Goblin Guard snatches it from the embers and shoves it into his mouth. He struggles to eat the rubbery tail but seems to be enjoying the taste. The Goblin Guard turns to prep another rat when he notices you standing in the river. He shrieks furiously and attacks you.

# Cave at the river exploration event
CAVE_AT_THE_RIVER_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=A rock formation rests to your left, and you notice an opening to a large den. Upon closer inspection, there are piles of small animal bones scattered around the entrance along with pawprints. You stiffen as you hear a muffled growl from behind you. You turn slowly and see a {0} with a silver fish clenched in its jaws. The {0} drops the fish and charges you aggressively.

# Goblin raiding party exploration event
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The Goblin Pikeman falls to the ground, and you whirl around. You caught the first Goblin Pikemen off guard, but the rest of them are ready.
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=The Goblin Shaman falls to the ground. You glare at the remainder. You are about to attack when you realize the goblins are running away. Cowards! You sprint after them, but they have a head start. The goblins disappear into the woods like rats, and it is impossible to follow them. You retreat to the farmer and describe the situation. You insist on staying the night in case the goblins return, and for your trouble, the farmer gives you a pouch of bronze coins.
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=You promise the goblins will be dead by nightfall and leave the farm promptly. The hills are a stone throw away, and you even see smoke rising from a cook fire. These goblins have become arrogant. It is the middle of the day! You trek up a slope and notice a goblin encampment with bones strewn everywhere. It seems like they have been gorging themselves. With an enraged cry, you charge down the hill and attack a Goblin Pikeman.
GOBLIN_RAIDING_PARTY_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=**You gained {0} Bronze Coins.**

# Abandoned hunting lodge exploration event
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=After a long day of rest, you decide to further explore the Whispering Woods. Treacherous paths, covered with leaves, moss and wild animal footprints can leave you to most unexpected places. As you’re making your way through thick forest, you see a strange light coming from the north east. Adventure spirit within your heart leads you to the source of the light – an abandoned hunting lodge. You circle around the lodge, and see that it’s very preserved, but overgrown in vines and moss.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Curiosity drives you forward, and you decide to enter the lodge. As soon as you opened the door, a Gnoll sees you and draws his weapon and charges you. Gnolls are vicious, territorial and very fast – you cannot outrun it, so you draw your weapon and prepare for a fight!
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=The battle was fierce, but the vicious creature stood no chance against you. As the Gnoll tumbled down the stairs at the lodge entrance, releasing the last shriek of pain, you enter the cabin. You look around the lodge and consider trying to search for any treasures that Gnoll might have collected.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=The battle drew too much of your strength. You decide to leave the lodge for now, as you might need all the strength you can get on your way home – you never know what lurks in the forest, and watches over passengers, their potential prey.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=After spending some time searching the lodge, you fail to find anything of use to you.  You can’t help but feel that there is something that you might have missed, but you’re too exhausted and decide to head back to the City of Sevgard, and return to the lodge some other day.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=After searching the lodge, your sharp eye noticed a hidden trapdoor on the floor. The door is made out of hard wood with iron ornaments. Your curiosity is still fueling you as you open the door and head down the old wooden stairs, into the root cellar. Suddenly you notice a loud shriek – it’s a rat! The rat charges at you, ready to sink its razor sharp teeth into your flesh. You hold on to your weapon and prepare for another fight!
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=Another foe slain as you move to further explore the cellar. To your surprise, and luck, the cellar was hiding several precious items, as you found {0}! Bright smile on your face concludes that the adventure was a success, and you start heading back to the City of Sevgard, happy that you found both treasures and new stories to tell at the inn.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Return to the City of Sevgard.
ABANDONED_HUNTING_LODGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Search the lodge.

# Hermit in the cave exploration event
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=Thick fog surrounds the City of Sevgard as you walk past the city gates. Rumors of caves filled with various treasures, glorious artifacts of old and mythical weapons of heroes of legends drive you forth into exploring more of the enchanted Whispering Woods. Loud howls don’t inspire fear in you while venturing deep into the forest, trailblazing into the unknown, where no one else went – or at least never came back alive to tell the tale.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Suddenly you notice pale blue wisp, floating in the air. As you approach the magical creature, it seems like it’s playing in mid-air, and chuckling. As soon as you get close to it, it floats further away, and the chuckles become more and more vivid. “Come play with me! Catch me if you can!” it said. Deciding to play along, you follow the wisp, becoming more and more relaxed and unaware of your surroundings, slowly losing the sense of time. Through the thick fog, hop and a skip above a small creek, down the small ledge, the game went on. Speed of an experienced adventurer finally caught up with the wisp, and as soon as you grabbed it, it vanished, leaving you on a meadow surrounded by forest on all sides, and a cave on the north-west.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=While approaching the cave, you see an old man sitting in front of it, and he looks like he’s meditating. The Hermit notices you and starts mumbling something that you don’t understand. He looks thin and weak, his long grey beard tells you that he’s very old, while his eyes are dark – as if the Whispering Woods drained all his energy and emotions. Despite your friendly “Hello!” the old Hermit charges at you with his club. You tumble onto the ground, barely evading the hit, and prepare yourself for combat – the old man is a lot stronger than he looks!
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=“That crazy old man sure put up a fight! I didn’t know that old men can hit that hard!” you thought to yourself while drinking up a flask of bone regenerating potion, to help heal your left hand bone. It seems like it suffered a strong blow from the Hermit’s bludgeon. You look up and see the Hermit’s cave, and wonder what kinds of items the crazy old man hoarded.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=You decide to search the cave, which looks like it has been maintained daily! It resembles a very neat living space, with a comfortable bed, alchemist table and plenty of books, written on a language unknown to you. In the end of the cave is a gold plated wooden chest, locked with an iron padlock.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You could try to pick the lock, or smash the padlock with your weapon.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=Success! The padlock was no match for your lockpicking skills, and you found {0} inside the chest!
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=The padlock is too sturdy for your lockpicking skills. Still, your weapon can easily crush it.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=You smashed the padlock, and you found {0} but some items like {1} were crushed.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=Your hand suffered a hard blow, and it needs rest. Best decision is to head back to town, get some rest, and some food in your belly, and come to the cave some other time.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Search the cave (you will lose one movement point because of the injury).
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Go back to town.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_3=Pick the lock.
HERMIT_IN_THE_CAVE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_4=Smash the padlock.

# Chasing the goblins exploration event
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=A familiar gate guardian face lets out a well-known “Take care, adventurer!” and a nod, as you walk past by the city gates. Even though the area is dangerous, most of the townsfolk know of your bravery and skills – which results in many job offerings. Nonetheless, you’re an adventurer, and accept no permanent job, for you find it boring, and it can’t calm the adventurous spirit of your being.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Down the treacherous path you wander, further exploring secrets of the woods. After suddenly hearing footsteps, you decide to rapidly dash towards the source of the sound. They are far too quiet to be human, and run on a far faster beat! Tearing up the branches, sliding through the bushes and finally you see the creature - a goblin! Just as suspected.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=“Prepare to meet your maker, Goblin scum!” you roared fiercely as you charged the creature. But instead the usual hissing and strange words on goblin tongue, the creature let out a loud shriek and fell on its back, trying to cover its face with tiny hands. As if that shock wasn’t enough, it spoke on common-world language, which was used by many races but not goblins:
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=“Please, have mercy! Don’t kill me! I didn’t do anything, I’m no warrior! I was just researching! Please don’t hurt me!”.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=“You speak our language? How is that possible?”, you answered, but still on your guard.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=“Yes! Instead of choosing the path of war, like many of my tribe folk, I chose the scholar’s way of life! I studied many races and languages, and began speaking the common-world language. Because of the way I chose, others bullied me and exiled me! So I’m wandering the forest alone, researching and learning many things! I recently discovered a glade with miraculous water, which can heal wounds! I can take you there, as a token of appreciation for not killing me. What do you say, friend?”.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=If he was a scholar, why did he need a sword he pulled out? Nonetheless, he’s dead now, researching forests and meadows in the realm of death. No Goblin is to be trusted, and they all deserve punishment.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=You cautiously followed the little Goblin separatist, while observing the surroundings. None of the paths seemed familiar, and each new part of the woods seemed more and more amazing. Finally, the small party of two arrived at the glade. Stunned by the beauty of the isolated glade, you watched as small birds and butterflies flew over the water that poured forth from the miraculous spring, while also noticing many new species of flowers and plants that you’ve never seen before.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=As you turned to the Goblin separatist, he let out a loud shriek and a fierce Goblin Guard, armed to his sharp, dirty teeth, charged towards you from the surrounding bushes!
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_10=Goblin Guard fell down, smitten by your mighty blows. But just as you thought to send the little tricky Goblin separatist to hell, another guard appeared. Tired, but not ready to give in, you prepare for another battle, while the hatred towards Goblin scum fueled your fists.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=Finally, the combat is over. Careful observing of the surroundings made you sure that there is no one else here but you and the Goblin separatist. “How could have I been tricked like this?!”  , you think to yourself. Your fists yearn for vengeance, but the rest of the body seems to be too tired to continue. The Goblin separatist looks as he is about to start running away after his plan failed.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_12=A look full of hatred thrown to the Goblin separatist tells him that this is not over just yet. As you turn around he starts running away. “Another time, Goblin. When we meet then, I’ll be prepared, and make sure that I send you to the realm of the dead!”, are the only thoughts in your head. Battled two Goblin Guards and won, but still can’t help the feeling of defeat – you swear that you’re never going to be tricked like that, as you’re making your way home.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_13=Being tired cannot stop you from killing the Goblin that dragged you into ambush. The trickster starts to run very fast back into the woods, and you follow him.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_14=Past combat with two Goblin Guards had much impact on your stamina. This time, you can’t keep up with the separatist. “Another time, Goblin. When we meet then, I’ll be prepared, and make sure that I send you to the realm of the dead!”, are the only thoughts in your head. Battled two Goblin Guards and won, but still can’t help the feeling of defeat – you swear that you’re never going to be tricked like that, as you’re making your way home.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_15=The creature ran, as fast as it could, through the thick bushes, thorny vines, over dead roots and branches, but nothing helped it. Finally, you had the separatist cornered. But, cornered beast is the most ferocious one. Goblin Separatist hissed, showing his teeth as he revealed a sword it had the whole time. Another combat begins!
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_16=Little treacherous creature lies dead. Exhausted and barely standing, you start heading back to the city, but relieved that you didn’t let the Goblin Separatist slip through unpunished for his treachery. Who knows how much trouble he could have caused if he trapped someone who is not such an experienced adventurer and can’t defend himself!
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_17=You draw your weapon, ready to face the vermin. To your surprise, the “scholar” has a sword! You fiercely charge the bastard who tried to trick you.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Kill the Goblin. They’re not to be trusted.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Follow the Goblin. After all, he’s just a bookworm, he can’t do much.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_3=Go home. You’re too tired for another battle.
CHASING_THE_GOBLINS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_4=Attack the separatist. The little scum will pay!

# Goblin king exploration event
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The grape wine served at the inn was great that morning, and you enjoyed the flavor, sipping it slowly.  There’s been a strange atmosphere in the town lately. Some soldiers went missing, and some witnesses saw an Orc-like creature dragging them away and killing them. Orcs have been attacked on the streets, even though some of them serve Sevgard as valiant soldiers. In the middle of your wine tasting enjoyment the inn door opens wide, with a loud bash, as two wounded soldiers collapse on the floor. They’re scared to death, mauled and heavily wounded. A nurse that happened to be having breakfast at the inn hurries to help them. You can’t approach them as the crowd is too thick, but you hear them say several words: attacked, friends slaughtered, great goblin. Without hesitation, you rush outside. Fury and anger engulf your mind. “If that 'Great Goblin' resides in the forest, he may be responsible for all the attacks on Sevgard and nearby homes. Time to pay, bastard!” are the only thoughts in your head.
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Following the footsteps of city guard patrol, you venture deep into the forest. “So many footsteps go into the forest… So few return… I’m going to end this!” .
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=After half a day of tracking the footsteps, you find a bloody scenery. Smashed parts of armor, half eaten bits of flesh, broken weapons. A pile of corpses of Sevgardian soldiers as well as some goblin corpses. You turn to the right and notice smoke nearby. Sneaking up to the source of the smoke and climbing a small ledge you see an enormous goblin standing next to a fire. The beast is cooking an elk, so it seems that killing citizens of Sevgard is just for fun, not for the actual food. This angers you, but you take a closer look at the huge goblin. It’s a bit taller than an average orc, his body muscular and strong, his skin looks hard to pierce, but it’s scarred, as it encountered other adventurers and Sevgard soldiers before. Killing this thing will be tough, but the people of Sevgard will not be safe until the monstrosity is slain.
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=The Goblin king will pay, but not today. You sense that his power is way greater than yours, so you decide to retreat for now. The road back to Sevgard is long, probably because of all the thoughts of innocent people slain by the beast, but you cannot do anything about it now. The sense of helplessness drives you to become stronger, to protect the weak and to finally slay the King of Goblins.
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=You let out a deep sigh as you draw your weapon. This might be your biggest challenge yet! “For Sevgard!” you shout, as you jump from the ledge onto the King of the Goblins!
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You won! You triumphed over the sadistic beast and fall down on the ground. The battle was fierce, his skin was thicker than any armor, his blows were hard, and his speed was surprisingly great. It took most of your energy and now you need to rest. Kneeling beside the enormous corpse is very unsatisfying, but you just can’t find the strength to move. You noticed several goblins surround you, but they keep their distance. Their master was slain by a stronger warrior and they show their anger by letting out loud shrieks and showing their teeth. They're moving in, inch by inch. The anger in you is not enough to regain your energy, you are still kneeling. You grab your weapon, and shout: “Come on, you scum! I’ve killed your master! You’re no match for me! Come on! Let’s end this! For Sevgard!”. Your screams of fury are not enough to scare the goblins away, but they have another effect, something you were not aware of – Sevgard’s cavalry rode for the forest after the guards at the gate saw you rushing to track down the Goblin King. They heard your screams and rode swiftly to your aid. After hearing the sound of Sevgardian war horses, you gather all the strength you have left to raise your weapon high, and shout “Victory!” before collapsing on the ground.
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=The goblins were no match for the finest riders of Sevgard and were quickly dealt with. The town guards took you back to the Sevgard inn to recover.
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=After your recovery a feast is held in your honor, as you are once again hailed as the Hero of Sevgard!
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Attack (Warning! You’re about to attack a Boss! Boss creatures are extremely difficult to kill!)
GOBLIN_KING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Go back home.

# Feast of a ghoul exploration event
FEAST_OF_A_GHOUL_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=After a good dinner when sleep still doesn’t come to you, you decide to go seek some adventure in the woods and your steps lead you to the ancient cemetery. You hear the sound of crunching bones and loud chewing just a few steps from the gate. You go to investigate the source of the sound and find something truly terrifying. In front of you there is a man-like creature with dark grey skin crouched over a dead body and gnawing on its ribcage.
FEAST_OF_A_GHOUL_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=The dead body, as you now realized, probably belonged to some other adventurer just like you, at least as far as you can tell from his leather armour and a broken longbow lying next to him.
FEAST_OF_A_GHOUL_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=You try to creep closer for a silent kill but the creature suddenly stops feasting and sniffs the air. After a couple of sharp breaths it turns its head to you and you recognise a ghoul. The ghouls eyes lock on you like the eyes of a predator as it pulls back its lips to show you two lines of crooked canines still glistening with the blood of its prey and already hungry for more.
FEAST_OF_A_GHOUL_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=The ghoul charges at you with long steps that are surprisingly fast and with its claws up, ready to tear your head off. In the last second you manage to grab your weapon to defend yourself.
FEAST_OF_A_GHOUL_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=After your victory you approach the dead adventurer. His stomach is torn open but his pouch is still intact. He won’t be needing it anymore, so you decide to take it. You gained {0}.

# Mad mage exploration event
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=As you’re wandering through the Wispering Woods your path leads you straight to the Cemetery. You decide to make a little round trip in hopes of finding some buried treasure or at least getting to know the place better. You walk along the wall trying to decipher some of the names on the tombstones but have no such luck since the gravestones are all so weathered it’s a wonder they stand at all, let alone being legible.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=After going halfway around the cemetery you notice a small shack huddled beside the cemetery wall with smoke coming out through cracks in the roof. As you come closer you notice a broken section of the wall of the cemetery and climb over the ruins. You approach the shack and knock. The door slowly opens inwards, creaking on rusty hinges, revealing a view of a person showing you their back and dressed in a dark cloak and a cape over their head so there is no way to know the person‘s gender. They are hunched over a cauldron hanging above a fireplace. There’s no telling wether the cauldon contains a soup or a potion but just the smell makes you think you would never drink it even if it was the only thing, that could save you from dying.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=„What is it?“ the stranger asks impatiently and turns to face you. Before you stands a man with a raspy voice, pale face and the darkest eyes you’ve ever seen. They are as black as the deepest pit and their whites are riddled with dark veins.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=„Oh, another dark mage hunter, are you? At least I won’t have to work with those centuries old rotten bodies,“ he says as he prepares a spell.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=As the mages black eyes turn blank and his blood makes a dark red puddle around him, you notice a trapdoor in the corner. You open it and find a ladder leading down into darkness.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=It’s too dark down there for you to see anything so you just close the trapoor and return to Sevgard.
MAD_MAGE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=You take out your torch and light it in the fireplace before going down. You enter a cellar too big for the hut above and full of tables with bodies in different levels of dissection. You turn away from the bodies and see what must be the dead mage’s work desk. You quickly search through its contents and find {0}. With your pouch full of loot you climb up from the cellar, trying not to look at the dissected corpses, and return to Sevgard.

# Graverobbers exploration event
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=It’s already dark. Today your day of adventuring is a little longer than usual and you decide to make it even longer. Because who wouldn’t get excited by the idea of a graveyard in the moonlight? You are nearing the rusty iron gate of the cemetery when you see a flickering light and near the wall to your left. As you come closer, you start hearing the sound of metal on dirt and soon you see two men covered in tattered cloaks shovelling dirt next to a half-ruined tombstone.
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Graverobbers, you think just as one of them accidentally hits the tombstone with his shovel. They both look in that direction in surprise and notice you standing there.
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=„Oi! You there!“ shouts the one standing opposite you in a voice as ragged as his clothing, „Come ‘ere!“
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=Believing no harm can come to you from the hands of two poor man armed with shovels you approach them.
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=„Got some money on you? Gimme your money!“ orders the other graverobber.
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=After killing the first robber you see the second one, who was struggling not to fall in the now half-uncovered grave, charging at you with a small hand axe in his hand and a desperate look on his face.
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=After the fight you search the robbers‘ broken bodies and a sack that was until now hidden behind the tombstone next to them and find {0}. You then walk away and get back to Sevgard without further accidents.
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=You give the robbers a handful of coins from your purse hiding it from their sight so they don’t know you have more and hastily take your leave. As you walk through the gate you exhale with relief. That was close… You quickly go back to Sevgard, luckily with no other accident.
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=„You asked for it!“ screams one of the graverobbers as he drops his shovel and pulls a dagger from his belt.
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Give them 20 bronze coins.
GRAVEROBBERS_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Refuse them.

# Zombies exploration event
ZOMBIES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=It is already late night when you are on your way back to the city after a group of pesky goblins had lured you deep into the Whispering wood. You’d followed them for a few hours but when the sun had set, you’d given up.
ZOMBIES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=You’ve been on your way back for at least two hours when finally you reach a familiar part of the forest. The shortest route to the city leads through the Woodland cemetery and since you’re very tired already and want to get some sleep as soon as you can, you decide to go that way.
ZOMBIES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=As you’re crossing the cemetery you hear a sound like bare feet shuffling through grass and dirt somewhere behind you. You turn around and to your horror you see a dark human-shped figure limping towards you. As it gets closer it is clear that this body has already been killed once a long time ago.
ZOMBIES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=It used to be a man but now it is a zombie with rotten greyish skin, wearing a tattered tunic with a round hole framed with dry blood right in the middle of the chest. Possibly caused by a spear or a javelin. It is also wearing the remnants of woolen breeches. The limping is probably due to the fact that one of its knees seems to be broken and almost bent in the opposite direction than it should be.
ZOMBIES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=The monster quickens its pace and charges at you with one arm raised up ready to strike.
ZOMBIES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=As soon as you finish this zombie, another one attack you. This one is missing its left arm and the parts of its skin you can see seem to have been scorched in a fire.
ZOMBIES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=Originally you wanted to stay and chat but a sudden sound of running feet makes you change your mind. You start running and stop only for a moment at the cemetery gate to look back. There are at least a dozen shadows hustling, shoving and fighting over the two dead zombies. All you can see is dark skin and a flash of teeth here and there but that’s by far enough to know that you should not stay for too long. A pack of ghouls this big is too much for you to fight single handedly.
ZOMBIES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=You turn and run for a few hundred feet. Then you slow down to a fast walk and hurry for the city.

# Kiss of a Vampire
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=You walk around the forest, looking for monsters to exterminate. Night is time of darkness and evil, and you are armed only with a simple torch and your bravery. Before you realize it, you arrived at the cemetery. You feel dark yet alluring presence, beckoning you to come closer. Your senses turn sharp as you sense chill on your spine. Something isn´t  right, spirits of the woods whisper to you. You steel your will and walk further into cemetery. There, woman of unspeakable beauty stands. Somehow, she isn´t standing in night, if feels like night itself was made to accentuate her beauty. Pale skin, ruby lips, eyes black like obsidian, figure fit for goddess. She sharply turns your way and looks straight into your eyes. You freeze, unable to tear your gaze away. Slowly, excruciatingly slowly she licks her lips, beckoning to you to come closer.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=You slowly walk to her, mesmerized by her eyes. She slowly puts her arms around your neck and pulls you closer. As she kisses you, you enjoy soft sensation of her lips. You are enraptured by her very existence, and feel you were meant to be with her . Your mind is wandering and you barely notice stingy sensation on nape of your neck. You look at her.  „It´s too late now“ she whispers and kisses you again. Of course it is too late now, you think, noticing sharp canines stained by your blood. You are one of her kin now. A vampire, one of rulers of the night. You return into city, trying to forget about what happened,  but you know some things cannot be ignored.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=As you draw weapon, fear appears in her eyes. When you close in, she bares her teeth and you  spot sharp canines not fitting for human being. She´s a vampire!
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=You look at dying vampire. She looks at you with sad eyes, sad enough to make you feel slight regret.  With breathing her truly last breath, she crumbles into ashes. She wasn't human after all, you say to yourself, happy that you didn´t get decieved.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=You turn around and run with all of your might, without turning back. You are not willing to get yourself into possibly deadly danger because of lust or curiosity.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You stride through the forest with confident steps. You don´t need to carry torch like you used to, nor you have to steel your heart because of darkness. Night is your domain now, as one of the lords of darkness you have nothing to fear. Mortals cower and run when they spot you, praying to the gods that won´t save them. Animals don´t dare to come close, and lesser undead bow down obediently. You arrive at cemetery, this time you understand that presence you felt at time you were mortal was call of vampire queen. You stride towards her and stop few steps away. Do you want to stay like this forever? 
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=You turn around and walk away. She gave you power you never asked for, chosen fate you would maybe decline if you had choice. You want to live free. Bask in sunlight and enjoy beauty of nature. You refuse to be plaything of hers anymore.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=„Rise“ she commands. You do so obediently. She steps toward you and kisses you. Once again you euphoric feeling from her kiss appears, and you indulge in it. Being queen´s favorite is good, as long as you don´t fall from grace.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=You have been healed for {0} health!
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_10=You are changed to a Vampire! \n\n - \\+ 10 maximum health\n - \\+ 25% increased prices in the shop\n - \\+ 25% marketing fees because you need to use the black market\n - Can't use the inn's services.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Succumb to temptation, and kiss her. She is asking you to do it, true men do not hesitate.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=You steel your heart against the seductress. Something isn´t right here. You are pretty sure it´s a trap. You draw your weapon and attack.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_3=You back away and run with all your might. You are pretty sure monsters are nearby and you don´t like prospect of getting ambushed.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_4=You step a bit closer and kneel. Despite being her kin, you are smitten by her beauty uncommon even among vampires  and you want to pay your respects.
KISS_OF_A_VAMPIRE_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_5=Turn around and walk away. She stole your humanity before, what will be next? Free will, vitality, or maybe your very soul?

# The Pit
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=An old potion master from Sevgard requires some yew cones and, being a good helpful  guy, you venture to the cemetery where they are supposed to be of the best quality. As you approach the cemetery you notice a big yew tree a few dozen feet into the woods with huge cones as red as droplets of blood glittering in the sunlight, which is really not a very encouraging picture near a cemetery but work’s work, so you plunge in between the bushes lining the path and make your way towards the tree.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Looking up at the tree in order to not lose your direction you don’t pay much attention to the ground. Suddenly your foot steps into empty space and you fall into darkness and land with a crack of braking bones. Once your eyes adjust to the lack of light you realize with a relief that the braking bones weren’t yours. But your relief soon turns into dread and disgust when you notice the whole ground around you is covered with snow-white bones.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=You stand up to get a better look at your surroundings, turning some more bones into dust in the process.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=You are in a cave . The only source of light is the crack in the ceiling, through which you got in here, and a faint hint of sunshine far to your right. You begin walking towards the far light hoping to find exit but stop when you notice movement in the corner of your eye. You turn in that direction and notice that a pile of bones near the cavern wall is shining with a ghastly glow and moving like a nest of snakes slithering over each other. And there’s another one on the other side. Skeletons!
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=Before the first one fully assembles you take out your weapon and try to rush it but you don’t get there in time and the skeleton blocks your attack with some other dead person’s thigh-bone, wielding it like a club.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=After your enemy crumbles to dust you quickly turn around and see the second skeleton charging at you waving an arm over his head like a creepy flail.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=You start to raise your weapon to protect yourself but you’re too slow. Your lack of reflexes is rewarded by lots of pain and a scratch just above your left eye. You quickly step back and raise your weapon to defend yourself as you try to blink away the pain and blood.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=You quickly raise your weapon and block the first attack. You then shove your foe away, making it stumble backwards to regain its balance, and charge for a rapid attack.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=After you defeat the last skeleton you stomp on the lying bones just to make sure none of them will stand up and attack. As you’re doing that you come close to a wall opposite the faint light, where there is a dark corridor. Maybe you could go explore a bit.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_10=You run for the faint light and in finally find the exit. You pass under a stone jaw full of jagged teeth and finally you are out of the cave and ready to never come back here ever again. You look at the empty sack stashed under your tunic and just shrug. You’re not going back there for any cones anytime soon.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=You check your rucksack but find no torch in it. You can’t go exploring there without light so you turn away and go for the exit. As you leave through the cave’s mouth full of jagged stone teeth you look back and make a mental note to come here again with a torch. You look at the empty sack tucked under your clothes and shrug. It wouldn’t hurt to go collect at least some cones. You return to the city with the sack full of red cones and the happy alchemist pays you some coins for your hard work.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_12=You take out your torch and light it before going into the corridor. After a dozen steps you see a silhouette in a shape of a glittering stone about four feet high. As you get closer the silhouette starts moving and in a few moments another skeleton stands in front of you. But this one is 7 feet tall, broad and clad in heavy armour. In his hands a heavy ax and a shield. You stop abruptly, feeling terrified, but then you think: I’m and adventurer, damn it. You then raise your weapon a charge screaming the word “death“ as a battlecry.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_13=You breathe heavily as you look down on the remnants of the slain monster. You carefully step over the lying pieces of armour and enter a small room that was probably used for some kind of treasury. Most of the jewels and weapons seem rusted and worthless but there is a wooden chest that stayed intact. You try to lift the lid but without success. The padlock is probably intact too.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_14=You tried your best but the lock won’t budge. You try to smash it with your weapon but that doesn’t work either. In the end you just search the rest of the room and find **{0}**.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_15=After you got your pockets full you leave the room, walk across the cave full of bones and finally out through what looks like an open mouth full of stone jagged teeth.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_16=After a few tries the lock suddenly clicks and opens. You open the chest and shout with glee when you see **{0}**. You move all the contents of the chest into your pockets and in a quite cheerful mood you walk through the cave full of bones and even the entrance shaped like a gaping mouth full of stone teeth can lower your excitement. You look at the still empty sack from the potion master and energetically march back to the yew tree and fill the sack with cones. You then return to Sevgard and give them to the smiling alchemist who pays you generously for your effort.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_17=You get 30 Bronze coins.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Go explore the corridor. It might be risky and you need a torch for that.
THE_PIT_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Head towards the light and try to find the exit.

FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The cemetery was indeed, truly eerie. As you approached, a strange, utterly unnatural chill crawled up your spine. The atmosphere was thick with the bellowing of widows from the past, their cries could be heard in the echoes among the graves. As you stepped over the grave of a forgotten man, a daunting figure suddenly came into view. From behind some some foliage that concealed a grave beside a bloodied tree stump, a strange man stepped out to confront your presence in this ancient place. Two small, single-grip crossbows were in each hand. To be able to accurately duel wield such weapons hinted to them either being a fool or an absolute force to be reckoned with. Of course, you proceed with caution. His eyes scanned you, they poked out from just above the high collar of his full leather jacket that concealed much of his face. Merely a pale nose was the only other visible trait of a face, which was hidden by the shadows cast from the adorned pointed leather cap. No matter how many times they washed their garbs, it was hard to hide the ever consistent smell of otherworldly blood from their person. His hunting clothes were an unnatural shade of black, which would cast a silhouette against even the darkest of night skies. "The way you walked into this cemetery tells me everything I need to know about you. You're either as foolish as a hunger-driven bandit or as brave as one of my guild brothers." The figure suddenly spoke aloud.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Indeed, if the man so wished - he could have killed you in an instant. Instead, he probed your appearance from a distance and deemed you not worth a stake in the heart. "There's a brightness in your eye, something that you do not see often in people other than myself and my brothers. I would give you a name, but you are not a guild-brother. Names are for friends - you're still a stranger. For easy reference, just call me Yip. No, it is not short for anything." His words instantly enthralled you. This mysterious stranger had certainly obtained your attention. "If you are ever perused by otherworldy beings, go to Sevgard - the cobblestone street where the beggars never sleep. Between two abandoned homes, you will find a doorway with a red arch. Once inside, you'll find what looks to be an abandoned shop. Behind the counter, there is a door built into the floor - from there, you will find people who will be able to help." You were unsure if this information as the most wholesome thing you needed to hear, or perhaps it was the most worthless. Your heart and mind tugged with the ideas of whether this was a person worth trusting. After all, he may have been a graverobber, a thief or a swindler himself. "If you think you are worthy of being among my comrades, perhaps you will partake in a trial and show your worth?"
FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=There was nothing else in the cemetery for you to investigate. You headed back toward Sevgard to partake in some drink and deep considerations.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=The cemetery was indeed, truly eerie. As you approached, a strange, utterly unnatural chill crawled up your spine. The atmosphere was thick with the bellowing of widows from the past, their cries could be heard in the echoes among the graves. As you stepped over the grave of a forgotten man, a daunting figure suddenly came into view. From behind some some foliage that concealed a grave beside a bloodied tree stump, a strange man stepped out to confront your presence in this ancient place. Two small, single-grip crossbows were in each hand. A bolt whizzed through the air toward you, shot from small, hand-held crossbows. Your instincts thankfully allowed you to dodge it with relative ease. The silver-tipped projectile is buried deep into the stone of a smallish tomb just beside you. Your eyes darted back to find that the stranger in the graveyard was no longer in plain sight. Your ears twitched as you heard the sound of silver studded leather boots run around you. The man's attempt to flank you would have been a success if you did not react as quickly as you did. With a great show of agility, you dashed into some bushes for cover, a bolt narrowly missed your head yet again. Whoever this person was, they had impeccable aim - their projectiles would have hit a less agile foe with ease.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5="Hmm, should have known you were otherworldly the minute you stepped in here." The hunter quipped, he lowered his weapons and dug his face deeper into the higher collar of his jacket. It was strange to receive mercy from the hunter, as this man had attempted to kill you just moments prior. "If you truly think of your curse as a gift, I will do no harm to you. But I cannot promise the same mercy if you go on to hurt any locals or encounter any of my brothers. If we cross paths again and you are still in this state, I will be forced to stake your heart and conclude your story as if it were a solace-filled poem, written by a drunk squire or unemployed scribe." The man jested, but his threat was still to be seriously taken. "Alternatively, I know of a cure." Your entire face raised with curiosity.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6="There is something special in you, I can see it, I can sense it - just as you nearly taste the blood rushing through my veins right now, as we speak. In Sevgard, at the Beggar's Street, where they beg and get no rest - between two buildings is an abandoned shop. There is salt at the entrance and above it a red arch, recently repainted. Inside, behind the counter, you will find an entrance in the floor - it will lead you to a small hall. Tell them that guild-brother Yip sent you. Inside, you will find something truly great. Your salvation. But it will come at a cost, the cost is loyalty to the guild and to repay the debt that you will inherit once taking upon the trial and being cured of your vampirism. It was the same path I followed, soon after encountering a guild-brother in this very cemetery, as you have yourself." Yip reached beneath his coat and assumed a defensive stance. From the jacket, emerged his two crossbows in each hand. They were pulled back and at the ready, silver tipped bolts aimed at your stomach. "At the same time, as I see mercy in your eyes, I know that vampiric side all too well. And right now, your eyes speak of hunger. And thirst. So go ahead, make Yip the hero of his own local, folk-poem."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=Yip predicted your movement before you could even make it. His crossbow was aimed to fire, but you were able to swipe at his wrist. The bolt is fired into the nearby tree, shredding deep into the bark with its silver tip. You shove the hunter back with great force. His body tumbled through the shrubbery and his face planted firmly against a stone grave marker. Yip re-emerged seconds later with a bolt that whistled past you narrowly. Some blood dripped from a small laceration that split his left brow. "You are like a wild beast. Monsters like you deserve nothing more than the grave. It was foolish of me to expect anything remorseful behind those dreaded, cursed eyes." Yip spat the words out as if they were venom. A struggle between life and death began at this very instant.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=The battle with the vampire hunter in the cemetery will go down in history, for sure. Yip put up a tremendous fight and you can feel both sweat and blood leave your brow. You huff for breath and even your otherworldly form is eager for some rest. "So, this is how it ends... never thought I'd lose yet again to a vampire..." Yip held a single gloved palm against his sucking chest wound. Blood slurped beneath the pressure he applied, but his wounds were far too grave. He would not give you any satisfaction from this victory, however. With his free hand, he removed the blade concealed on his leg and with its tip - lowered the now bloodied collar of his leather jacket. His pointed cap fell to the ground, to soak beneath his black-haired head in a pool of blood that continued to grow. With a ceremonial blade, Yip had the last laugh and prepared to thrust the blade across his calloused and scarred throat. "I always knew my life would end violently. A hunter such as myself does not simply go away peacefully in his bed in old age... No, I gave up that privilege with my vows to defend this world from the likes of you. However, my vow does not necessarily mean I have to die at your wretched kind's hands..."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=Yip sliced his throat in front of you. As you left the cemetery, you took a mental note of Beggar's Alley. Most likely it would be a trap or at least heavily guarded. It would be unwise to go there alone without back up or a trump card of some sort.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Accept the help.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=Attack the vampire hunter, he must die!

FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=It was strange that you so suddenly accepted the advice of a peculiar man in the cemetery and decided to venture forth into Beggar's Alley. As the name suggested, you were instantly assaulted with a barrage of homeless individuals, who thrusted their empty palms for you in hopes that their tired pockets could be filled. You managed to escape them, only to find the old, barren building with the red markings around the door frame. A small line of salt had been drawn in front of the entrance.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Your senses picked up something in that instant. Someone had drawn a bolt against the string and let it set. They aimed and fired, you quickly jolted your body from its relaxed state to an alert one. You attempt to dodge the deadly projectile.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=Your Vampiric reflexes have served you well. With a simple side step, the bolt whizzed past your face and its deadly head settled between two steps of cobblestone.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=Your Vampiric reflexes could not help you this time around. The sneaky marksman who shot at you landed a painful blow into your leg. You grit your teeth, but still managed to release the bolt from your flesh - its head knotted with some of your bloody tissue.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5="Cease this! I have not come to kill any of you!" You pleaded. At that moment, you could hear some crossbows be reset in the darkness. From the rooftop, several figures emerge from their hiding places. You did not even notice them when you entered the alley. A man and a woman present themselves to you. They pass through the gate and seem ready to spare you. A third Witchhunter emerged from the opposite side of the alley, they were disguised as a beggar and they previously had their hand extended out for your kindness.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6="Not a bad shot, for a greenhorn such as yourself." Their Captain complimented the girl. He even gave her a friendly pat on the back as he passed them. It was smart, the captain had disguised themselves as merely one of the starving locals, so they could relay information back to their contacts on the rooftops. This operation was surely well thought out. "You will earn your first scalp soon enough, young one. You will be a worthy ally on 'The Path' one day."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=As you pondered over what exactly "The Path" was to these hunters of beasts, their Captain approached you and removed their disguise. His short, silverish hair only complemented the jagged scars that ran diagonally across his face. "If you have not come to cause harm, who are you then? Are you the one that encountered our friend Yip in the cemetery?"
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=You followed the strange directions to an even stranger place. Past the gates, you enter what was known as Beggar's Alley. Indeed, the reputation met the name. You were confronted almost instantly by the homeless and starving, who offered their empty palms to you. You pushed past them and progressed forward, toward a door with a red marking. Just like what Yip described, back in the cemetery. You noticed the line of salt in front of the door. You are tempted to playfully sweep it aside with your boot.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9="Is this it? This dump among the beggars is where this dreadful Guild hides in plain sight?!" You questioned loudly. Having been so distracted by the decaying scenery, you did not notice that one of the beggars had shadowed you from the entrance of the alley. At first, you assumed you were being mugged. He aimed a crossbolt for your head. "I imagine this is the right place then and you are not a proper-normal after all..."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_10=The Captain grabbed you by the shoulder and pulled you away from the door. With a shove, he made some distance and prepped his weapon against you - just in case you suddenly made any drastic movements or sudden transformations. "Turn around slowly, with your hands up, palms facing me." You had no other choice but to comply. "Who are you? How did you find out about this place? Was it you that encountered our friend Yip in the cemetery?" Beneath the hood, you saw that the nicely cut, silver haired Captain's face was an intimidating visage due to the diagonal scars. Two more Witchhunters scouted you out from the nearby rooftop.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11="Have you come to partake in 'The Path'?" The Captain interrogated.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_12="Please, I want to join this brotherhood of your's. To pursue a new path in life, perhaps "The Path" that defines your guild, your creed." You pleaded, as it was better to appeal now and have no doubts about this direction you have chosen. The Captain lowered his weapon and looked you over. "I assure you, I am capable of anything you ask of me."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_13=The old man stood up to you and lowered his weapon, his comrades did the same. With their hood removed, a somewhat more friendly, albeit still hideously scarred face emerged. "The name is Adrian. Adrian Claw-Marked. If you are so sure of this and want to partake in 'The Path' alongside us, there are some trials you will need to accomplish first." He sniffed the air, perhaps to get a scent of you so he could remember it for later. "Head to the farmfields, there is a farm under construction. Offer your apprenticeship there and perhaps, you will come closer to concluding the deeds necessary for joining our brotherhood. It will be the first of three." He said simply.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_14=The Witchhunters returned to their posts and left you be, so that you may start your tasks. However, the Captain stopped and peered over his shoulder to give you some advice. "Do not attempt to enter our Guild Headquarters until you have accomplished your Initiation. Otherwise, I will not stop my Guild-Brothers from turning you into a crossbolt pincushion and future beast-bait."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_15=You entered the farmfields and met a lonely old farmer, he was far too old to construct the Guild Checkpoint that was planned by himself. "Ah yes, you must be the one that old coot Claw-Marked sent. We are going to need at least 10 more Robinia Logs, 100 Bronze Nails and it is going to take some effort from yourself overall to help it all come together."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_16=The old farmer stretched his back and looked over what you had on hand. You briefly noticed that this old man has some tattoos related to the Guild. "It is good, but not good enough. You are still missing some!"
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_17=The old farmer crossed his arms, you noticed some scars on his forearms. Surely, he had seen his fair share of battles while working for the Guild. "This is very good. I will get together those who were commissioned to start work immediately. Go ahead and jump in and help them the best you can."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_18=After some honest, hard work in the sun - the construction was finished. You shared a hearty meal with the other workers and left, silently wondering if you would ever see those barely known friends ever again as they all parted ways.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_19=You have {0} of the required {1} from {2}.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_20=The Captain, dressed as a beggar, waited for you by the gates. He approached you and the two of you pretended to exchange a small monetary donation, so that on-lookers would not grow suspicious. "In the Whispering Forest, some greenhorns, a bunch of wet-behind-the-ears rookies are preparing for a job. Make sure they make it out of there alive and then come back for your final task."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_21=Just as quickly as you met, you left. While you left the Beggar's Alley, a somewhat wealthy, working man passed and verbally berated you for giving coin to the homeless.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_22=You are immediately greeted by some Guild-Rookies who had set up a small camp. You partake in some beverage and they briefly explained to you about what the local woodcutter had told them. While he was out, getting wood for the farm project for the Guild, he heard some strange noises from a hole in the deepest neck of the woods. Of course, the Guild was alerted and they were sent out to prove their worth. The three young-bloods and you set off to investigate. The woods are especially eerie on this night.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_23=The hole resembled more of a smallish cave, beside some large, rotted tree stumps. One of the young-bloods approached and noted its depth. "We are going to need a rope."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_24=You stare into the hole and note that if you were to jump down without a rope, you'd probably break both your ankles instantly and be at the mercy of whatever was down there. You ask if anyone else in the group had one, but their only reply are shrugs. You should probably find some rope.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_25=Luckily, you have a rope and tie one end to one of the tree stumps. Carefully, you and your party descend into the deep, dark hole.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_26=Fortunately for the small party, one of the young-bloods had some supplies to craft a makeshift torch. Once some light is cast on the situation, it is apparent that you are in the middle of a tunnel. After some bickering, you all agree on one direction and end up in a medium sized cave. Indeed, this was the housing for a goblin party. The light from the torch awoke them from their slumber, the greenhorns of the Guild spring to action and start to slaughter them. However, a large Goblin leader pounced from a make-shift hammock directly in front of you.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_27=You and the greenhorns managed to survive the Goblin nest. Before you were even done slaying the Champion, they had looted the nest in its entirety. One of the guildmembers decided to share the loot with you. Your received {0} from them, as well as a hastily written message on a piece of paper. As you and the greenhorns find a tunnel which led to the exit, you read it out-loud to yourself.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_28="Return to where this all started for you. One of our own has gone missing there."
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_29=It was obvious you had to return to the cemetery.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_30=As you approached the cemetery, you noticed the dead body almost immediately. Indeed, it was one of your own. You investigated the corpse, only to find that it was still alive. But not in a natural way. Far from it.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_31=It was time to prove yourself. You grab for your weapons and approach the ghoulish corpse, as it suddenly sat up and began to ravenously approach you. It was hungry for the flesh of the living.
FINDING_THE_GUILD_QUEST_STARTING_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_32=You were saddened by how Kian met his demise. You burned his corpse, but the flames brought something wicked your way. You felt little victory as you returned to the Guild. Adrian Claw-Marked himself announced that you were a righteous addition to the brotherhood. After a small ceremony, the Witchhunters' Guild's doors were open to you from now on. Yet, something still tugged at your heart. For several nights to come, the visage of Kian, the Forsaken would haunt your dreams.

CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=A terrible curse has fallen upon you. The Guild recognizes this. There is only but one course of action. There is a Witch in the Farmlands, her name we do not speak. But those who know it, only do because they have suffered the same fate as you at one time or the other. Why has this terrible, foul creature not been slain? You will soon find out why in the rare cases the Guild shows mercy to such beings, it is for a good reason.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=In the far eastern reaches of the Farmfields, you find a small hut - decorated gorgeously in green moss. It looks like something out of a fairytale. At a distance, it was very attractive, but the closer you got the more filthy and deranged the wooden hut now appeared. You step past the illusion's veil and into the grim reality, a rotting hovel that covered a mere yurt. There was no beauty inside, but the stench of foulness and dark magic.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=The brave adventurer you are, there was no hesitation as you stepped into the hut and at that moment, brought yourself closer to your salvation from the dreaded Curse of Thirst.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4="My name is Auster," the dreaded creature speaks aloud. She wears a beaked, leather mask with tinted lenses. The nose of the mask smells greatly of flowers and gooseberries, as well as other herbs that were packed into it for some ceremonial reason. Her malnourished, mostly naked body was covered in black crow feathers dyed white. "Auster the Snow-Hen." The mad witch emits a screech like that of a mythological bird.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5="I am from the Guild, as you can tell." You state simply. "I am here for the cure of..." You glance at your wrist, where a passage was lightly scratched into your skin with an ink quill. "'Curse of Thirst'".
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=The Snow-Hen seems pleased you know of your conditions true name. "First you must scratch my back, then I shall scratch your's."
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7="I will do no such scratching, harlot." You proclaim. Auster laughs. "But I understand the metaphor, what must I do to gain your help?"
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8="You must grant me an artifact, that your dreaded guild has proclaimed I am not allowed to have. But in your condition, you are in no position to argue." She swoons, she was right after all. "Adrian Claw-Marked has finally permitted me to own this object, I desire. I need the 'Eye of the Crow'. But a bastard of a mad man mage has taken it for himself. He hides in the Marsh of Madness near here. His name is Volkstein."
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=You recognize quickly the miserable state of the witch, she is unable to take it from the mage himself. You must find this Volkstein and retrieve the Eye of the Crow, lest you be cursed forever.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_10=You head to the hidden Marsh of Madness to find Volkstein. After passing through an illusion-veil, you find that behind the false image of a plain bridge over a small creek was now truly a step into the darkest of ill locations. The Marsh of Madness is swampy, smelly and full of ugly plants. Evidence of the mage's whereabouts are everywhere, as barefoot prints missing a single pinkie toe on the left are scattered through the hardened mud. You being your search, already clenching your stomach.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=You find a decorated stone gate, with numerous runes and strange insignia carved into it. Being the quick-witted Guild Brother you are, you hop over it and avoid a magical trap that was at the main entrance. You find nothing but ruins, ancient ones. One must wonder how long this mage has been here and how long ago he truly went mad. You walk toward a ruined tower, it has been disguised with green tarps on every exterior wall - stretching from the top of the tower. Obviously, this was to mask its appear from the rest of the woodlands in case the illusion concealing the area ever failed.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_12=At one side of the tower, you find a fairly recent addition to the structure, a refurbished and recently painted red door. Volkstein must not be one for subtly. You approach with your trusty lockpicking tools and begin to do what all good Guild-Brothers do best, mess with other people's locks and dark secrets.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_13=With your skills, the lock was as easy as simply walking through the door. You try to carefully open it silently, but a gust of wind suddenly slams it hard against the inner wall. It startles you even more as a rat of unusual size, perhaps the result of dark magic, scurries away from the light that has cast away the blinding darkness. You see a long staircase leading into an underground chamber. Truly, the mad man Volkstein lived down there. Otherwise, there would not have been a decorative robe-rack just before it.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_14=You quickly descend down the staircase and find a dreaded workplace, where terrible things have taken place. In the dark, damp dungeon - you find numerous bookshelves that held books that were basically artifacts. These ancient texts seem to be bound in human flesh, stitched together with black hair and inked in blood. They contain bizarre burial rites, incantations and strangely enough - a complex encyclopedia of insects, some of which you have never imagined actually existing. A dreadful sound alerts you, with a swift step you turn around to face whatever it was. However, Volkstein is not seen. Instead - you are faced with a gnarly, brittle walking corpse!
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_15=You kill the death walking terror itself, only to hear another monstrous groan from a death-rattling corpse awake elsewhere. You prepare yourself mentally and physically, as another flesh eater casts itself into your vision from the darkness of this mad man's dungeon.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_16=The flesh eaters have perished and you return to your work. You feel like you have missed something, but cannot put your finger on it. You decide to study the room further, in a place you have not yet checked.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_17=You search high and low, but you find only one thing in the darkness of that dungeon - a fool, that being yourself. Disappointed, you turn back and travel to the city. You have found nothing and the shame is overbearing. You still feel the curse that haunts you thread needles of cold sweat down your back.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_18=You search high and low, but eventually you come near giving up. You feel as the curse haunts your body once more, that dreaded thirst. It threads needles of cold sweat down your back. It encourages you to look further, before you accidentally misplace the rug at your feet with a misjudged step. You realize that there is something other the rug. You kneel down and cast the rug away, a trapdoor is revealed.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_19=You tap yourself on the shoulder in congratulations and imagine the applause of an impressed, non-existent crowd of admirers as you open the hatch. You jump down into the darkness, for there is nothing you fear in times like this, more than your own actions under the curse. With your vampire capabilities, you pounce down to the floor after the prolonged fall. Only to see a rope ladder you could have easily used alternatively.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_20=You find yourself in the sleeping quarters of a mage, with minimalist decorations at most. However, there was a modest collection of arcane knowledge-based literature on a wooden table nearby. It distracts you momentarily, making you forget the thunderous sound that ripped through the echoing chamber when you landed. Volkstein, the mad mage, throws himself out of his bed - which resembles a coffin or a rich man's casket more than anything else.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_21="You fool, what are you doing here?! I am a law abiding citizens, I pay my taxes and these corpses were on my land! I have every right to do what I wish with them!" Volkstein begins to accuse you, his thunderous voice casts a small that lights numerous candles throughout the chamber. His skin is inked with self-inflicted tattoos, scarred from said inking instruments. His skin runs black with etched runes and incantations, as well as morbid formulae. He wares thin black robes, the only true covering on his body being filthy bandages. "You have come to take my beloved away, I shall not let you!"
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_22=Volkstein literally crumbles to dust after you strike the finishing blow. A winding twirl of bandages falls to the ground where his ashes now lay, their black robe hangs in the air on his apparition before it is cast into the ceiling - letting the fabric fall. His ghostly image haunts you only for a moment, you have come for his "beloved" and nothing will stop you from taking it. You start to flip through his things, casting aside the books that once interested you and looking curiously into every possibly hidden place. Finally, you inspect his casket to find a numerous collection of jewelry that was robbed from corpses. You receive (insert loot here) and find the "Eye of the Crow". Auster will be pleased.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_23=You climb the rope ladder and exist the ruins immediately. You have no time to encounter whatever monstrosities that Volkstein had in his home. You leave the place, almost thankful for the gut-wrenching smell of the Marsh of Madness in comparison to the condensed smell of ink and rot in the location you just left. It was time to leave, but not after destroying the stone gate marked with runes. By doing so, the illusion-veil was lifted and entirely. As you walk back to the city, you silently prayed that bandits and thieves would come to destroy this wretched place or perhaps make it their own, unknowing of the undead that likely stalked from afar. It was simply more job opportunities for the Guild.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_24=You return to the hovel the Snow-Hen Auster lived in, only to find that the illusion-veil has been lifted here as well. Curious, but also cautious, you approach slowly as to not be taken by any surprises. Frankly, you have had plenty to last a life time. Inside the decorated yurt, Auster the Snow-Hen nearly pounces you with joy. You are brought back by her intense scent and push her away. "You have found it! My former lover did not give you too much trouble, did he?" Auster questions.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_25="Former lover? That explains a lot, actually. I should have known there was a deeper connection between you two the moment I saw the runes on his gate." You state before pointing to the same runes that were carved into the hut - runes that granted a magical person the ability to cast an illusion-veil. It was obvious now, that this hut and Volkstein's gate were connected via a magical link. When you destroyed Volkstein's gate, it was broken - thus the illusions fell. "I feel there is something you are not telling me, but lucky for you - I need your assistance still."
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_26=You present to Auster the artifact, the "Eye of the Crow". She is delighted, so much in fact - she nearly snatches it from your hand. "I think we have a problem, Auster... Where is my part of the bargain? I scratched your back, now you scratch mine." You repeat the idiom she screeched about earlier. The Snow-Hen Witch starts to flap her false wings and squack loudly at you. You are taken back and start to feel increasingly suspicious of this unstable abomination. "Surely, you must understand I already have another thing scratching at my back. A dreaded curse that makes me want to render flesh and drink blood. I suggest you help me or I will be forced to take my reward with force."
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_27=The Snow-Hen rips off her leather-beak mask, revealing a nearly skeletal face, squirming with maggots in her empty sockets. She sticks her talon-like fingers into the beak and casts the strange packed herbs inside of it at you. Her horrible visage and the strange herb that hit you directly in the face both bewilder and persuade you. You close your eyes, but you only see her horrible face in the darkness - speaking to you. "I am but an old woman, an old woman you have denied her one true ornament, an anniversary gift stolen from me! And now, you shall give it to me!" A strange force propels you to hand over the "Eye of the Crow".
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_28=You fall back and out of the hut, rolling onto your side and springing up quickly. Your fangs visible as your curse's instincts kick in to self-defense mode. The Snow-Hen flaps her dyed-feather wings at you and pecks at the ground with her gnarly teeth, as she leaves the yurt. She tears into her flesh, spraying blood onto her humble hovel before rubbing the blood on the "Eye of the Crow" - lubricating it. "Now, you will feel my wrath and will taste what this old crone has in store for you!" She shoves the artifact into one of her maggot-infested eye sockets. "The Guild will pay for enslaving me!"
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_29=Auster lays at your feet, gargling on her own blackened blood. You go to kick her in the face, but she lunges up and takes to flight - like an actual bird. She perches herself on the top of her hovel, she screeches and a flock of crows suddenly swarm her violently. The sound of their flapping is deafening, the force and the winds they create nearly collapses the Witch's yurt. "Volkstein! I am joining you, I am coming home with what is our's!" She yells, surrounded by the thunderous tornado of crows. You jump back to avoid large ones that tried to peck out your eyes. The crows suddenly disperse, quickly and violently.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_30=They have picked Auster's corpse clean, the Snow-Hen was now a bundle of bones that collapses over her former home and rolled down into the dirt of this tarnished corner in the farmland. You are scared about the consequences you may face for killing the Guild's protected witch, but at the very least - you hope you can retrieve or at least reclaim the "Eye of the Crow". You search her earthly remains but nothing remained in the eye sockets of her skull, not even a single maggot. The crows have surely claimed it. In a way, Auster the Snow-Hen got the last laugh. You send a violent kick to the side of the hut, collapsing it. Apparently, her magic was the only thing keeping it up in the first place.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_31=Defeated and exhausted, you collapse in front of it and lay on your back. Pondering what you are to do. Something then catches your eye, buried within the fallen household of the witch. You spring up and find a dusty book, laying in the center of the floor - the front cover nearly touching the top of the collapsed ceiling that loomed above. You squeezed your hand in gently to retrieve it, the book is similar to that from the ruins in the Marsh of Madness. You open the human-flesh binding, careful not to disturb the fragile hair-stitching. Your eyes scan the blood-inked pages, you discover that it is a cure for the Curse of Thirst. You sigh in relief, now returning to the Guild.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_32=On the way there, you open the front cover of the book, to reveal a message written by Volkstein intended for Auster. "For there is a day that will come, as I have prophecized in my dreaded crystal globe - they will send a certain vampire to you. He is destined to kill us. I hope you find this passage in time. Please, give the cure in this book to the vampire so that he may not kill me and so that he may not kill you. Your's forever after - Volkstein. I am sorry I was unable to cure you of your condition, my love. Accept this final gift as we finally part ways."  You would have wiped away a tear if it were not for the fear in your chest as you entered the Guild with this dreaded book of arcane knowledge. Adrian's scouts have already seen what happened and reported back to him.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_33=Sir Claw-Marked is honest with you, he does not even seem mad. He sits you down and taps your shoulder, offering you a pint of beer. "Auster was mad, true. I am sorry everything has happened as it did. I am upset, I will admit - that you had to kill her. But I am more upset that you have come with a book in hand and not the "Eye of the Crow" even more."
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_34=Of course, you understand. But you present the book to him and reveal its contents. "But I have gained something even better, this book was written by a mad mage. I presume that the Auster Snow-Hen used his recipe cited here - to cure the Curse of Thirst." You close the book and present it to Adrian Claw-Marked. He gazes into your eyes, seeing that the thirst was increasing and you were now eyeing his neck. "I hope that I have done the Guild good in the future, by granting this book of my own free will to the archives.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_35=Adrian smiles and moves the beerstein closer to you. "You could have sold this to an antiquity, a historian or an occultist. Instead, you brought it here and did not even used the recipe yourself yet. I think you may just be among the bravest and most noble yet, among our brothers. So go now, make this cure with the ingredients we have at hand - so that you will be along the living for decades more and hopefully in our service." Claw-Marked laughs and takes a swig of his own beer. "Don't give me the sentimental half-grin of your's, drink and enjoy life - for by morning, you will have no curse in your veins or a desire to drain other's veins, for that matter."
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_36=After some drinking, you glance around the small herbalist kiosk inside the Guild's headquarters, you are happy to find that the necessary things were given to you free of charge, as Adrian promised. You sit alone at a table, away from the rest of the community, your only protection from them being a dark, hung cloth that acts as your shroud. Every once and awhile, you see a curious Guild-Brother taking a quick peak as they pass by. You look over the contents of the book, hoping that once it is in the Guild archives, you'll never have to read from it again. You prepare to compile the ingredients.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_37=It seems you made an exotic drink that fermented into something foul within seconds. You took a sip and could feel your guts revolt against the fluids. You quickly spit it out, it tastes as if you have sipped from a chalice that contained death itself. You must evolve your skills before you try again. 
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_38=On the bright side, your "Witch Moonshine" has become a popular drink among your Guild Brothers who are happy to credit you for its creation. 
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_39=A dark red concoction sits in the cup in front of you. You crush the last of the herbs and slowly let them soak in at the bottom of the drink. This menacing chalice stares back at you, your reflection looks even less human as you stare into it. This visage reminds you of why you are taking it in the first place, the redness resembles the ever beloved plasma your demonic tastes have yearned for. Now it was time for the moment of truth.. It tastes like sweet blood. Soon after, you pass out and awake come the morning - feeling a weight off your shoulders. You have been cured of the Curse of Thirst.
CURE_FOR_THE_THIRSTY_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_40=You fumble with the lock and make a fool of yourself in the process. Luckily, no one was in the general vicinity to see your failure. After all that effort you mustered up, you decide that a little more practice is needed before you can try tackling this one again. You curse the day that Volkstein was self conscious about his security measures and went out of his way to get something other than just a chair blocking the door from the other side. You look at your lockpicking tool set and wonder if it was them that failed you - rather than the other way around.

LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=The cemetery was cold, that late evening. As you warmed your hands with harsh breaths placed upon the palms, you witness a congregation of cursed individuals. The three vampires talk among themselves, looking as if they had just left their decrepit crypts merely an hour prior. Their forms are strong and their eyes were weary, yet wise. They were no young-bloods, but experienced apex predators who preyed on men. For one reason or another, your adventurer's intuition prodded you to follow them in secret to their clandestine meeting place. "We must hurry back, before Lord Nargoth grows impatient." One says to the other. They traverse the tombs and crypts around them with keen precision. Truly, this was where they felt most at home. Be wary, for a vampire in his element is a dangerous foe indeed.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2=Quick on your step, the anxiety of the situation betrays you - as your foot snags against a branch. The vampires' heightened senses recognize it as a sound no animal can make, indeed - it was a mortal's foot that broke the twig. "We are being followed!" The leader of the group alerted the others. His voice as grimy as an unkempt headstone. They turn toward the direction of the sound, they spot you almost instantly despite your concealment in the dark. They quickly move out and surround you. You attempt to flee, but you know you must prepare yourself for a fight for your life. As you trotted back and hid behind a crypt, they creep closer with malicious intentions. Hoping to catch them with the element of surprise, you throw yourself at them to attack first. "Kill the mortal! Lord Nargoth will reward us greatly!"
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3="You fool, I will carry on in your place!" Another vampire yelped, jumping over his dead comrade with his fangs trained for your neck. The leader of the group is joyously watching the tormenting battle from a perched position above a tomb.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4=The blood-sucker falls at your feet, kicking out as his life drains away from his now twitching corpse. The leader is astonished you have survived the encounter. He flashes his fangs as he jumps away, to go back into hiding. "You will not survive crossing our path again!" The creature of the night warned. Exhausted, you pant hard for breath as you lean against a headstone. You return to the safety of the city to tend to your wounds and to recover your strength. The haunting image of the Vampiric corpses will torment your dreams.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=The vampires converge toward a grandiose crypt. It is maliciously carved with ancient symbols and an alphabet more ancient than mortal history can calculate. Statues of marble depict virgin women, laying over a bundle of delicately crafted flowers. The statues themselves, are stained with blood - the virgin's stomachs are used as altars. Bloody offerings stink the air. The blood-suckers descend down the master-crafted stairs into the hidden crypt, you follow as swiftly as the wind at their backs. They were none the wiser.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You see what looks to be a throne room, with more statues of marble-cut women - their arms decorated with red offerings of bleeding organic tissues. The haunting site is only impacted further by the dreadful smell of death. Not crypt-dead, but fresh decay of recently eviscerated victims. A morbidly skinny Vampire Lord sits at a throne crafted of human skulls and gallons of hardened candle wax. "Lord Norgoth, we have completed the patrol. What is your wishing?" The leader of the scouts announces to him, this supposed Lord of Vampires.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7=Lord Norgoth's thick, long black blades of hair are pushed aside with his talon-like, skeletal fingers. His sunken eyes emphasized only more so by the complementing brown scarf that was fitted firmly across his missing bottom jaw. Their mandible and fangs visibly poking out. His voice, disembodied - as if his body was merely a puppet and a phantom ventriloquist voiced orders for him. "Leave me be, I am waiting another guest."
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=The scouts nod their heads, quickly leaving at the deadly premonition that was delivered to them. As they scurried out, you remain behind a marble statue - concealed just barely by its wide hips.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=Lord Norgoth is imposing, his dreaded visage inspires a fear in you that reminds you only of your own mortality. Hot on the heels of his humble servants, you take your leave as well. It seems that he knew you were there, but for one reason or the other - he had granted you mercy. It is best to forget this and return back to the city to rest.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_10="Come on out of the shadows!" Lord Norgoth commanded, from behind his throne - a black cloaked warrior suddenly emerged. He sprung out from the darkness and threw the marble statue in front of you down to the ground. The force of the throw broke it into many pieces. Norgoth's personal body guard ravenously eyes your neck. "Rip the lungs out of this intruder through his back after you split his ribs!"
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=The Vampire Warrior stumbles forward, trying to swipe at you in one final attack. You step aside, letting him fall into a marble statue - which topples over and crushes his head, splattering blood against the canvas of the floor. "Your gross over confidence will be your undoing." Lord Norgoth taunts, stepping up from his throne to assault you personally. "Your hot blood will quench my long endured thirst."
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_12=Lord Norgoth is knocked back into his throne, only to spur forward with a last jolt of life before he clumsily lands in front of you dead - having shuffled under his own dead weight and feet. You decapitate him, just to make sure that he stays buried in this crypt forever. Moving behind his throne, you find an impressively large crate. Surely, this was where all the non-bloody offerings went.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_13=A fool you are, to think that as an amateur lockpicker you could break into Lord Norgoth's chest. Frustrated, you tried to crack open the chest with a blunted object and even a marble statue's thick head. The fortified crate's contents are far out of your reach as of now. You return to the city, one chest of valuables poorer.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_14=Inside the chest, you find {0}. These were once belongings of adventurers who perished in an attempt to claim Norgoth's head. Someone even brought a celebratory alcoholic beverage to celebrate the occasion that never came.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_15=At the bottom of the chest, you see that there are three slots with strange markings. Curious, you try to insert three bronze pieces into them but nothing happens. Confused, you feel confident with the loot you do have and return to the city. Hoping that this crypt became lost to the ages and was allowed to finally crumble, with all the evil inside of it.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_16=At the bottom of the chest, you see that there are three slots with strange markings. Curious, you insert three coins of Drakkar into them - as they held the same symbol as the slots. A loud tick catches you off guard.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_17=A small compartment at the bottom of the chest opens, a magical stone peers out of the darkness at you - like a vampire's eyes in the night. Unsure of what it is, you take it anyways - an heirloom of the vampires, no doubt. You best keep it under wraps until you can find a place to sell the valuable item without any questions asked. If someone were to see you with such a possession, surely bad things would come to you. You take your leave, never wanting to see this crypt again. Hoping it falls into decay and buries the evil that was once here.
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_1=Attack the vampire lord. (Warning! You’re about to attack a Boss! Boss creatures are extremely difficult to kill!)
LORD_OF_VAMPIRES_EXPLORATION_EVENT_QUESTION_REPLY_2=He looks very powerful. Better to leave him alone and go home.

SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_1=Come night fall, you entered the forest to act as the host for the mysterious stranger. Alderz was timely and he seemed eager to see your otherworldy form. After a brief greeting, he was quick to get down to business. "Truth be told, I admire you 'strange folk' and want to become one of you." You were shocked by this and proceeded to ask him why. "For my line of work, I want to be one with the shadows - not merely a mortal hidden within them."
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_2="If you so wish to be afflicted with a curse, follow me and have no regrets." You warned and turned your back to head toward the Woodland Cemetery. Alderz followed you with an eager hop in his step.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_3=You have returned to the dreaded place of origin from which your curse came from. Alderz accompanied you on the journey back toward the Crypt itself. However, after an attempt at diplomacy - you failed. The devout Vampiric body guards scoffed at your feeble attempts to talk your way past them.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_4="You are a vampire yourself, no?" Alderz questioned your authority and strength at this point. "Show your worth! Let us fight them!" He was not quiet with his words, as they alerted the guards to his ill-conceived plan. They sprung in toward you for an attack!
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_5=MISSING_TEXT!
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_6=You and Alderz huffed and panted. The ground at your feet began to soak with the blood of the bodyguards. "You truly are stronger than I ever imagined. And yet, you wonder why I envy your abilities?" Alderz teased. You quickly walked past him, your shoulder shoved against his. You told him to stay level headed as you both enter the crypt to discuss some matters with the Queen.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_7="You must be mad, to kill two of my own and expect to request council with me!" Of course, she was utterly furious. Her angry words struck your composure like daggers, but only for a moment before you were able to reorganize yourself.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_8=You pleaded. "But alas, I bring you a man willing to be a host of your vampirism. In a way, you gain one for the two lost. I assure you, this rogue is worth two men as it is!" Alderz coughed at your brown nosing, while the Queen managed to form a smirk of interest. Perhaps you succeeded in capturing her attention.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_9=She looked him over, Alderz had a history of well fitted for a ghoulish being that lived best in the comfort nightfall's shadows. "Ah yes, this man is one of the Whispering Forest smugglers. They could prove useful to me." Alderz was humbled to know that the Queen knew of him and his brothers. He gave a brief bow. "In exchange for this gift, allow your services to extend to commissions from myself and my kind... Of course, as a smuggler you understand the world of coin and its uses - so I will also demand 10 coins of Drakkar."
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_10=You bit the inside of your cheek. Truly, the life this world offered only relied on two things. People you knew and how much coin you had. Alderz and yourself were then dismissed, your mind raced with thoughts that solved simple problems with impossible solutions. "I imagine you do not have 10 coins of Drakkar?" You interrogated Alderz. He gave you a sheepish look, which you replied to with a deep sigh. "Of course, that is the easy part. The hard part is convincing your fellow smugglers to welcome the company of vampires."
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_11=You and Alderz depart after an agreement to meet at a designated location in the Whispering Woods. Before he left, Alderz slipped you a small note with instructions to find this so-called "Smugglers' Heaven".
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_12=You followed Alderz's abstract and sometimes, overly poetic directions to a tree stump deep within the Whispering Forest. He emerged from the nearby bushes with a blade, as he at first mistook you for a rival or a snoopy investigator of some sort. "It would be really pleasant if you did not stab me," you stated. "We already have a hard task ahead without a few extra holes between my ribs." Alderz sheathed his small blade and knelt down by the tree stump. 
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_13="Keep an eye out for any snoopers." He warned, his calloused hands then reached beneath the stump and lifted it up like a hatch. He lead you down a make-shift dirt stairwell, constructed mostly out of hardened mud and wooden planks with markings from some kind of dock. Deep into the ground, there was a small network of tunnels and small 'homes' made wooden scraps of barrels, crates and furniture. This was Smugglers' Heaven?
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_14="Aye, welcome back Alderz. You uh' vampire yet?" A slinky, bean-pole of a smuggler joked. It seemed that vampirism was a long time dream of Alderz for all of his friends to now of it. Obviously, Alderz was not a big shot down here - at least not yet. Everyone hobbled together in front of their makeshift tables and kiosks, trading and selling stolen goods from fences who had links to the black market. On one of the mud walls in the back, a map of the tunnels painted on a tanned, leather hide showed just how far these operations actually went.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_15=Alderz introduced you, before you could give any salutations or bows, the smugglers released their blades from their sheathes. The skinny beanpole of a man personally crabbed for a bulky crossbow that was half his size. "Do not kill him! Do you not see, you fools? This is our chance to get our gang to the top!" Alderz pleaded, he slapped each of their wrists and tried to get them to see order through all of the chaos. "My friend here, they are a vampire, yes, this is true. But with their help, I can become one too! You wouldn't have anything to worry about with me, right guys?"
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_16=The skinny smuggler loaded their bolt into the drawstring of their weapon and pointed it at Alderz, who was quick to disarm him. He flung the man of mere skin and bones onto the ground. His other comrades were quick to raise their blades against their comrade and you - the vampiric intruder. The commotion caused the other, associated smugglers to ditch the main area for the tunnels from whence they came. "So, this is how it is going to be?" You taunted, ready to fight. "Fine, I'll give you a reason to fear vampires."
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_17=MISSING_TEXT!
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_18=After you had knocked your attackers hard to the ground, you quickly jumped up on a stool to free Alderz from a tight noose that had him hanging by the neck. It was tightly tied to a wooden support beam, it was a wonder it did not fall under the added weight of the struggling smuggler and collapse the whole Smugglers' Heaven. Alderz quickly gasped for air and rubbed his now red neck, the lynching would leave a ghastly scar. "No honour among thieves, I see? Who dares harm their own brother like this?" You questioned, looking around as Alderz's comrades gradually returned to the scene.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_19="Y-you're a vampire! Surely, stranger, you must understand why you intimidate us so!" One of the battered and bruised smugglers mentioned. He dropped to his knees to show his respect to both you and their commander, Alderz. "Forgive us brother, just do not force your soon to be obtained curse on us too!"
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_20=Alderz placed a hand on the shoulder of his remorseful fellow smuggler. "Worry not, but know this - I am not a ranting mad man no longer." The Chief Smuggler stood proudly, still wringing his neck lightly before he assumed his position as the head of his small group once more. "We are no longer small fish after this, we are going to be the big dog in the yard now. Once I gain this gift, I will have a direct connection to the other Vampires. We are going to have good jobs, with good pay, good loot and the best of rewards! Just know this, that if any of you dare cross me again - I will not need my friend here to protect me!"
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_21=The smugglers swore allegiance to Alderz, knowing that once he achieved a vampiric form he would bring them to new levels of glory. Deep down, you could sense that it was not the promise of good loot and alliance with otherworldly ghouls that concreted their loyalty. After you displayed your abilities in the fight, you showed them that the myths and legends were true. Soon, Alderz may even be your equal. "You intend to use fear, to rule them?"
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_22="I intend to use what is necessary." Alderz simply stated as the two of you left Smuggler's Heaven. "Meet me in the cemetery when you have 10 Coins of Drakkar. Thank you, for helping me back there."
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_23=MISSING_TEXT!
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_24=You entered the dreaded crypt once more, only to find that Alderz had already gotten there before you. The Queen was pleased to hear that you had accomplished your tasks. With Alderz's smugglers soon to become the most infamous in the area, as well as devoutly carrying out jobs for the Queen and other Vampires - it was apparent that the Queen was by far getting a better part of the deal through this bargain. Yet, you felt this did not necessarily concern you. You had other ambitions to pursue for now. As you transferred over the 10 coins of Drakkar, you felt a small tinge of sorrow in your heart. You felt less like you were about to free Alderz of the idles of humanity and instead - doom him to slavery. A slave to his own thirst.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_25=MISSING_TEXT!
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_26=Alderz was prepared and ready, but audibly gasped when he was suddenly hit with a paralyzing spell. He looked back at you, a moment of regret in his eyes mixed with the fear. The smuggler stumbled and before he could fall to the floor, the Queen took him into her arms. She bit deeply into his neck, but you sensed something was wrong. She began to suck a tremendous amount of blood out of him, his paralyzed body twitched and began to lightly convulse. You raised your weapon to attack her, surely she was trying to kill Alderz! He was a scumbag, but he did not deserve such a fate! As you tried to strike, you too - were inflicted with the spell of paralysis. You felt your muscles harden and soon you tipped over like a broken statue. Darkness overcame your vision.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_27=A few hours later, you wake up. You stretch your body out slowly, every muscle is fatigued and you are both physically and mentally exhausted. There was no sign of the Queen. In fact, the crypt felt bare, as if there was nothing here at all and never has been. You crawled toward Alderz to find his unconscious body barely clung to life. His eyes shot open as you pulled him from the floor. "D-did it work...?" He questioned. You see the unnatural look in his eyes and his new set of teeth. You nod and he smiled in response. You throw him over and onto your back. It was time to carry him all the way back to Smugglers' Heaven.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_28=His allies were at the tree trunk, they had been waiting for his return. At first, they nearly attacked you again - until Alderz waved a hand to command them to stand down. You laid Alderz by the wood stump and as one of the Smuggler's Black Market Doctors approached the nearly dead Alderz. They all shivered in fear during the medical examination. Their leader had indeed turned into something else, he was barely recognizable and his presence gave off grim premonitions. "Come back with two lesser healing potions. Otherwise, his recover is going to be long and grueling." The Doctor suggested. You felt sympathy for Alderz, as his body's chemistry and his soul's very being had changed. It was your fault. You left to retrieve some medicine. It was the least you could do.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_29=MISSING_TEXT
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_30="Thank you." Alderz stated simply. Those potions will serve him well. He gave you a vampiric grin. "We will serve the vampires as they served mortals... With hopeful intentions and good cheers and jests." He sarcastically added.
SMUGGLERS_HEAVEN_QUEST_EXPLORATION_EVENT_ENTRY_31=You gained 2 gold coins. Alderz mentioned that being a vampire closed some doors but also opened some new ones up. While he waited for you to come back with the potions, he sent some scouts to do some investigating. As a sign of his gratitude, he offered to help smuggle you into a caravan route that leads to the next village when the opportunity arises.
