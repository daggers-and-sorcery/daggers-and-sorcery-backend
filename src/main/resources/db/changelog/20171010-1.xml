Welcome Adventurers!

We are happy to announce the release of a new quest, the Cursed Heroes. This quest is by far our longest one, consist from 8000+ words and a lot of bossfights. It is accessible by finding an exploration event in the Woodland Cemetery. Be careful however, multiple bosses will await for you.

Sadly the reward of the quest is not accessible at the moment, it will be released in the next update probably next week.

Sincerely, Daggers & Sorcery Team
