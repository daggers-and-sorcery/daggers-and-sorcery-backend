Welcome Adventurers!

Based on your suggestions regarding yesterday's update we have me made some small changes and rebalancing. We hope that you will like it.

Improvements:

- Lowered the Robinia Log requirement of the Bloodthirsty Staff's recipe from 12 to 6.
- Added Stem as a drop to the vampires. You should use scavenging to improve your chances to acquire some.
- Added Garlic Bread to the game. It is one of the top healing foods available in the game.
- Added recipes for Bread and Garlic Bread.
- Added the Magical Bronze Arrow to the game. It can be made with the Imbuing skill and provide slight bonuses over the Bronze Arrow.

Sincerely, Daggers & Sorcery Team
