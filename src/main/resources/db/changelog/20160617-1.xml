Welcome Adventurers!

We are happy to announce that our hiscore system, the Ladder is finally here. It's a really simple implementation at the moment but we think it's enough for now. We hope that this will enhance the community/multiplayer part of the game a bit.

Also after looking into the player feedback we decided to change our priorities a bit and delay smithing until we do some combat rebalancing. We are aware that some of the monsters are too hard to kill especially for non-melee races (Draconic, Elfs, Gnomes) mostly because magic is not implemented yet. This is our next priority to fix. After these problems are fixed we will add smithing and also a very basic tutorial menu/screen that will help new players to get into the game faster and easier.

We have a small ongoing facebook campaign to find new players. Sadly the budget is really tight but we are trying to get a small initial player base.

You can find our facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/DaggersAndSorcery/). If you have any problems or remarks about the game please feel free to write a comment/message either on the Facebook page or in the Inn's chatroom.

Thanks, The Daggers & Sorcery Team
