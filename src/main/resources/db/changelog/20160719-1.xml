Welcome Adventurers!

Today we are releasing the first part of the Whispering Woods! Not every drop are final for every monster and also not every dropped item work as finally intended but these things will be corrected later. Until then we are giving you the opportunity to collect them. We also reworked how the exploration system works to make it easier for the developers to add new exploration events.

Improvements:
- Added the 'Whispering woods' exploration place to the game.
- Fixed the magical amulets unidentified by the 'Lesser identification' spell.

Thanks, The Daggers & Sorcery Team
