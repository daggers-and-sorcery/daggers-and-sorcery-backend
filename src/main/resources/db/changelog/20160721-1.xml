Welcome Adventurers!

Lots of new equipment is finally out. We are plan on releasing even more soon.

Improvements:
- Added more drops to the Goblin chieftain's reward chest.
- The 'Bronze chestplate' and the 'Bronze platelegs' are made equipable and a recipe is released for both of them.
- Using the 'Bronze chestplate' the players are able to get experience in the 'Heavy armor' skill.
- Redesigned the 'Bronze gloves', 'Bronze boots', 'Leather gloves', 'Leather boots' items.
- Added the 'Leather tunic' and 'Recipe: Leather tunic' to the game.
- Using the 'Leather tunic' the players are able to get experience in the 'Light armor' skill.

We are aware that until the ranging skills are released the bronze equipment is far superior to the leather one but this will be addressed once the ranging skills are out.

Thanks, The Daggers & Sorcery Team
