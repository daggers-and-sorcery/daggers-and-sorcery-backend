Welcome Adventurers!

We are releasing the last combat style, ranging to the game. You can get ranged equipment from the monsters in the 'Whispering Fields' region. Be careful however, you not only need a ranged weapon but also ammunition. If you go on exploring with a ranged weapon in your hand but without any ammunition then you will end up fighting with your fists and that can be lethal if you not well equipped.

Improvements:
- The ranged combat is available in the game.

Bugfixes:
- The 'Leather hood' and 'Bronze helmet' items were not equippable because of a bug. This has been fixed.

Thanks, the Daggers & Sorcery Team
