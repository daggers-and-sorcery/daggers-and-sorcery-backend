Welcome Adventurers!

Finally, we had some time to work on the inventory page. We got a lot of feedback about it but and we are trying to fix the problems you had with it. From now it will be a lot easier to find your items.

Improvements:
- Added new recipes and weapons for five new skills. These new weapons are dropped by the monsters in the whispering woods.
- Replaced the 'Coin' item type with 'Money'.
- Replaced the 'Ore' and 'Bar' item type with 'Material'.
- Added subtype for items. This was quite a big change, we had to rewise every item in the game to decide about it's type and subtype again.
- Reworked the inventory portion on the character page. The items in your inventory are sorted by type from now. This way it's a lot easier to find anything in your inventory. We have more plans to make it even easier but we want feedback on this new system before proceeding any further.

Thanks, The Daggers & Sorcery Team
