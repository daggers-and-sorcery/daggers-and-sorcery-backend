Welcome Adventurers!

We are happy to announce that for this weekend the regeneration rate is lowered from 5 minutes to 3 minutes! This is temporarly for this weekend only but if you like it and it doesn't break anything we will leave it there.

Improvements:
- Lowered regeneration rate from 5 minutes to 3 minutes (temporarily at the moment).

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug that rendered the combat settings in the settings menu unusable.
- Fixed a minor textual error in the cave event.
- In the old man event the old man asked for some copper coins. He will ask for bronze coins from now on.
- Increased the attack value of the 'Bronze Axe' and the 'Bronze pickaxe' because when players equipped a 'Bronze kite shield' with it then they had less attack than what's required to hit the monsters. We are doing such a microadjustments because the Farmfields is considered a newbie zone by us, however in the next zones we not going to be such helpful in the case of equipping the wrong combination of items.

Thanks, The Daggers & Sorcery Team
