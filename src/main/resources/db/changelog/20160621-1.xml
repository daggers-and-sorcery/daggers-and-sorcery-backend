Welcome Adventurers,

With this patch, we are releasing some minor updates and bugfixes. More small scale but useful updates will come later this week.

Improvements:
- Improved the skill display on the character page by separating trading and combat skills. Trading skills are shown at the top because those are the most accessed skills by the players. After this update, you don't need to scroll down to the bottom of the character page just to open the smithing interface. Also, we made the skill page links a bit easier to find/visible by adding a small "(Skill info)" text.

Bugfixes:
- Increased Bronze pickaxe's stats because sometimes it was too low and made some monsters unkillable on the early levels.
- Fixed that the ladder was very inconsistent at times. Sometimes it was shown 20 users on a page but on other occasions, it was shown 40 etc.

Thanks, The Daggers & Sorcery Team
