                Welcome, Wanderer!

                I am pleased to introduce you to a new fantasy, roleplaying game called Daggers &amp; Sorcery. When you create your character, you can select from eight different races. For example, there are elves, dwarves, gnomes, and draconics.

                This is an early beta release of the game. However, the game is stable enough that your character will not be deleted after the open beta period has ended.

                We are a very small indie studio which consists of two people. We try our best, but mistakes can happen. If you find a bug, please report it directly to laxika91@gmail.com.

                If you have any ideas that could improve the game, contact us through the game's official subreddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/DaggersAndSorcery/

                Stay tuned for further updates. We plan on releasing an update per week. The next planned update is highscores, and a detailed development road map will be posted shortly afterward.

                Thanks,
                The Daggers &amp; Sorcery Team
