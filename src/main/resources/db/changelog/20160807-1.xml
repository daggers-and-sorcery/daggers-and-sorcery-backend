Welcome Adventurers!

We are happy to announce that the long awaited rework of the shop is finally here. The rework took more time than expected but the whole shop was redesigned.

Improvements:
- The items in the shop are grouped by type for easier searching.
- Added icons for the prices and prices are not shown in only bronze coins anymore.
- The player's money are shown on the shop screen.
- You are able to see the properties of an item before buying it, not just its name.

Thanks, the Daggers & Sorcery Team
