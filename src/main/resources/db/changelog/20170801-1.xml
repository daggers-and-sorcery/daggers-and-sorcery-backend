Welcome Adventurers!

We are here again with a patch that brings a lot of quality of life improvements to the game. We wanted to address these issues before starting to  work on the Vampire Lord exploration event.

Improvements:

- Renamed the 'Lesser healing potion' to 'Potion of Healing'
- Added icons to the item types in the inventory, on the shop page and on the market pages.
- Added a name to every exploration event. It's visible on the exploration page's header.
- Added 'Potion of Mana' to the game with a new herb and a recipe for it.
- Added 'Silverleaf' to Herblore's Gathering function.
- Created a landing page for the game. It's visible for everyone who opens the game for the first time.
- Replaced the existing "flash texts" that showed if an action like creating something was successful or unsuccessful with popup notifications.
- Added an explore again button to the exploration screen to lessen the scrolling required to reach different exploration locations.

Sincerely, Daggers & Sorcery Team
