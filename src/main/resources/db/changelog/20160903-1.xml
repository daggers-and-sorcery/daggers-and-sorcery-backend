Greetings adventurers!

We are happy to announce the release of a new skill, Lockpicking!

Improvements:
- Added a new event with new monsters and items.
- Added a new skill, the Lockpicking.
- Separated the skills on the character page to four groups instead of the existing two. (Combat, Magic, Trade and Shadow skills.)
- Lowered the amount of the gnoll's attack.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug that enabled players to gain a lot of defense experience while fighting the monsters. The defense experience that a player can gain while fighting a monster is based on the monster's level.
- Fixed a bug that made players stuck in combat and unable to explore.
- Fixed the combat messages when using ranged attacks. The players no longer shooting themselves.
- Fixed a wrong text entry on the abandoned hunting lodge event.
