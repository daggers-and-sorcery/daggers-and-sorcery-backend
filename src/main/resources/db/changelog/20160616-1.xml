Welcome Adventurers!

We are releasing a small patch to address some of the problems with the crafting skills.

Improvements:
- Added Fox skin as a drop for the Goblin Piker and Goblin Guard with 3% chance to make leatherworking a little easier to start.
- Added Frying pan as a drop for the Goblin Piker and Goblin Guard with 2% chance. This item was required by cooking but nothing dropped it.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed the name of the recipes in the Leatherworking Recipe screen for Leather boots and Leather gloves. Both was incorrectly named as Leather strap.

We also working on a ladder system to enhance the community and improve the player interaction a little bit and also on smithing that will be released soon hopefully.
