We are happy to announce the first planned extension for the Witchhunter's Guild. We have enabled the shop so if you are a player
with guild rank higher than Newcomer head to the shop of the guild and look around for some new equipment. With this patch, we added
the first ring slot item to the game and a new arrow type that's useful for the vampire hunters.

We are planning more extensions for the Witchhunter's Guild in the future so stay tuned.

The next patch will probably arrive next week with some general bugfixes and small improvements. The next bigger content patch is
scheduled for the end of the next week where we will release a new quest that will help some of the "cursed" players to find the
cure for their misery.

Sincerely, Daggers & Sorcery Team
