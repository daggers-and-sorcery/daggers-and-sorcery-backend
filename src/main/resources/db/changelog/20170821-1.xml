Welcome Adventurers!

This week's patch is a smaller one but nevertheless, it will add some really great additions to the game.  The Life Leech attribute is coming to the game with a couple of new weapons.

Improvements:
- Added a new attribute called Life Leech into the game.
- Buffed the Vampire Lord a little bit because we found it too easy to kill.
- Added a new spell called 'Might' to the game. It's increasing the melee attack/damage and defense capabilities of the character based on its willpower.
- Added five new weapons as drops to the Vampire Lord.
- Added two new quests to the Witchhunter's Guild.

Sincerely, Daggers & Sorcery Team
