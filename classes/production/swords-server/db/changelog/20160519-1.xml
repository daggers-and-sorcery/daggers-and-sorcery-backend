Welcome, Wanderers!

We are happy to announce that the Inn has been released. If you want to order some ale or rent a room for a night, look up the Drunken Dragoon in Sevgard! However, it will cost you a fair amount, so prepare your coin pouch accordingly.

The site has a new background and atmosphere to it. We will focus more and more on the graphics in the upcoming weeks.

In the following weeks, we plan to release more exploration events and a new skill to let you use your gathered materials.

Also, we fixed some of the bugs.
- Goblin Guards sometimes carried 4 Bronze Axes for no reason. This has been fixed. Now, they drop a maximum of one.
- Fixed that Bronze Sword gave Shortbow experience instead of Shortswords.
- The item Bronze Sword had no image. Now, it has one.
- Various small fixes in the exploration event texts.
- You are no longer going to forcefully log off from the game after 30 minutes.
- The overly aggressive and very dangerous animals in the cave event are replaced with much friendlier ones. (However, they still bite!)

Thanks, The Daggers &amp; Sorcery Team
